        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Background: AI systems in healthcare face significant challenges regarding bias, fairness, and clinical deployment. While promising results have been reported in controlled settings, real-world implementation reveals substantial gaps between laboratory performance and clinical utility.

Objective: This study examines the ethical and practical challenges of implementing AI systems in healthcare, focusing on bias detection, mitigation strategies, and frameworks for equitable patient outcomes.

Methods: We conducted a systematic analysis of peer-reviewed literature and examined documented case studies from healthcare implementations. Our approach emphasized identifying bias patterns, evaluating mitigation approaches, and developing practical frameworks for ethical AI deployment.

Results: Our analysis reveals significant challenges in ensuring equitable AI performance across diverse patient populations. Key findings include documented performance variations across demographic groups and the critical need for enhanced validation protocols in clinical settings.

Conclusions: Addressing AI bias in healthcare requires comprehensive approaches including diverse training data, regular algorithmic auditing, enhanced transparency requirements, and continuous monitoring protocols. We propose a framework for ethical AI implementation that prioritizes patient safety and equitable outcomes.

Limitations: This study represents a framework-development exercise. Specific implementation details require validation through peer review and pilot testing before practical application.</p>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>This research employed a multi-phase systematic approach combining literature analysis, case study examination, and framework development. Phase 1 involved comprehensive review of peer-reviewed studies published between 2020-2024 focusing on AI bias in healthcare. Phase 2 examined documented implementation cases from major healthcare systems. Phase 3 developed practical frameworks based on identified patterns and requirements. All analysis followed established systematic review protocols with emphasis on reproducibility and validation.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>Analysis identified three critical areas of concern: (1) Performance disparities across demographic groups with documented variations in diagnostic accuracy; (2) Insufficient validation protocols in real-world clinical settings; (3) Limited transparency in algorithmic decision-making processes. Case studies revealed implementation challenges including data quality issues, integration complexities, and regulatory compliance requirements. Framework development resulted in a comprehensive approach addressing technical, ethical, and practical considerations for healthcare AI deployment.</p>
