    "expected": {
        "answer": "Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. It involves algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. Machine learning approaches are typically classified into three broad categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. These methods are widely used in applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous systems.",
