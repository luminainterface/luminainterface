Both terms are frequently used in science and media, sometimes interchangeably, sometimes with different meanings. In this work, we aim to clarify the relationship between these terms and, in particular, to specify the contribution of machine learning to artificial intelligence. We review relevant literature and present a conceptual framework which clarifies the role of machine learning to build (artificial) intelligent agents. Hence, we seek to provide more terminological clarity and a starting point for (interdisciplinary) discussions and future research.

This is also true for Machine Learning methods on Knowledge Graphs, which has led to a steady increase in their application since the beginning of the 21st century. However, in many applications, users require an explanation of the Artificial Intelligences decision. This led to increased demand for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence. Knowledge Graphs epitomize fertile soil for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence, due to their ability to display connected data, i.e. knowledge, in a human- as well as machine-readable way. This survey gives a short history to Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. Furthermore, we contribute by arguing that the concept Explainable Artificial Intelligence is overloaded and overlapping with Interpretable Machine Learning. By introducing the parent concept Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence, we provide a clear-cut distinction of both concepts while accounting for their similarities. Thus, we provide in this survey a case for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs consisting of Interpretable Machine Learning on Knowledge Graphs and Explainable Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. This leads to the introduction of a novel taxonomy for Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs. In addition, a comprehensive overview of the research on Comprehensible Artificial Intelligence on Knowledge Graphs is presented and put into the context of the taxo",

Motivated by the complementary nature of human and machine intelligence, an emerging trend is to involve humans in the loop of machine learning and decision-making. In this paper, we provide a macro-micro review of human-in-the-loop machine learning. We first describe major machine learning challenges which can be addressed by human intervention in the loop. Then we examine closely the latest research and findings of introducing humans into each step of the lifecycle of machine learning. Finally, we analyze current research gaps and point out future research directions.

Smartphones, social media platforms, search engines, and autonomous vehicles are just a few examples of applications that utilize artificial intelligence technologies to enhance their performance. This study carries out a scoping review of the current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technologies following the PRISMA framework. The goal was to find the most advanced technologies used in different domains of artificial intelligence technology research. Three recognized journals were used from artificial intelligence and machine learning domain: Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, Journal of Machine Learning Research, and Machine Learning, and articles published in 2022 were observed. Certain qualifications were laid for the technological solutions: the technology must be tested against comparable solutions, commonly approved or otherwise well justified datasets must be used while applying, and results must show improvements against comparable solutions. One of the most important parts of the technology development appeared to be how to process and exploit the data gathered from multiple sources. The data can be highly unstructured and the technological solution should be able to utilize the data with minimum manual work from humans. The results of this review indicate that creating labeled datasets is very laborious, and solutions exploiting unsupervised or semi-supervised learning technologies are more and more researched. The learning algorithms should be able to b",

This review provides a comprehensive overview of AI-driven approaches tailored for microbiology and microbiome studies, emphasizing both technical advancements and biological insights. We begin with an introduction to foundational AI techniques, including primary machine learning paradigms and various deep learning architectures, and offer guidance on choosing between machine learning and deep learning methods based on specific research goals. The primary section on application scenarios spans diverse research areas, from taxonomic profiling, functional annotation & prediction, microbe-X interactions, microbial ecology, metabolic modeling, precision nutrition, clinical microbiology, to prevention & therapeutics. Finally, we discuss challenges unique to this field, including the balance between interpretability and complexity, the \"small n, large p\" problem, and the critical need for standardized benchmarking datasets to validate and compare models. Together, this review underscores AI's transformative role in microbiology and microbiome research, paving the way for innovative methodologies and applications that enhance our understanding of microbial life and its impact on our planet and our health.
