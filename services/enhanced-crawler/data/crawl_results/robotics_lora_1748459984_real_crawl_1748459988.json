Daszczuk , Waldemar Grabski , Sambit Bhattacharya View a PDF of the paper titled Cooperation of Multiple Autonomous Robots and Analysis of their Swarm Behavior, by Bogdan Czejdo and 3 other authors View PDF Abstract: In this paper, we extended previous studies of cooperating autonomous robots to include situations when environmental changes and changes in the number of robots in the swarm can affect the efficiency to execute tasks assigned to the swarm of robots. We have presented a novel approach based on partition of the robot behavior. The sub-diagrams describing sub-routs allowed us to model advanced interactions between autonomous robots using limited number of state combinations avoiding combinatorial explosion of reachability. We identified the systems for which we can ensure the correctness of robots interactions. New techniques were presented to verify and analyze combined robots' behavior. The partitioned diagrams allowed us to model advanced interactions between autonomous robots and detect irregularities such as deadlocks, lack of termination etc. The techniques were presented to verify and analyze combined robots' behavior using model checking approach. The described system, Dedan verifier, is still under development. In the near future, timed and probabilistic verification are planned.

Vokhidov View PDF Abstract: This paper presents a study on autonomous robot navigation, focusing on three key behaviors: Odometry, Target Tracking, and Obstacle Avoidance. Each behavior is described in detail, along with experimental setups for simulated and real-world environments. Odometry utilizes wheel encoder data for precise navigation along predefined paths, validated through experiments with a Pioneer robot. Target Tracking employs vision-based techniques for pursuing designated targets while avoiding obstacles, demonstrated on the same platform. Obstacle Avoidance utilizes ultrasonic sensors to navigate cluttered environments safely, validated in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Additionally, the paper extends the project to include an Elegoo robot car, leveraging its features for enhanced experimentation. Through advanced algorithms and experimental validations, this study provides insights into developing robust navigation systems for autonomous robots.

However, the unpredictable conditions of space pose significant challenges for robotic systems, necessitating the development of advanced learning techniques to enable autonomous assembly. In this study, we present a novel approach for learning autonomous peg-in-hole assembly in the context of space robotics. Our focus is on enhancing the generalization and adaptability of autonomous systems through deep reinforcement learning. By integrating procedural generation and domain randomization, we train agents in a highly parallelized simulation environment across a spectrum of diverse scenarios with the aim of acquiring a robust policy. The proposed approach is evaluated using three distinct reinforcement learning algorithms to investigate the trade-offs among various paradigms. We demonstrate the adaptability of our agents to novel scenarios and assembly sequences while emphasizing the potential of leveraging advanced simulation techniques for robot learning in space. Our findings set the stage for future advancements in intelligent robotic systems capable of supporting ambitious space missions and infrastructure development beyond Earth.

The research enables the robot to autonomously select its locomotion mode and path in complex terrains. Focusing on walking and flying modes, a Gazebo simulation, and custom perception-navigations pipelines are developed. Leveraging deep learning, the robot determines optimal mode transitions based on a 2.5D map. Additionally, an energy efficient path planner based on 2.5D mapping is implemented and validated in simulations. The contributions demonstrate scalability for future mode integrations. The M4 robot showcases intelligent mode switching, efficient navigation, and reduced energy consumption, bringing us closer to fully autonomous multi-modal robots for exploration and rescue missions. This work paves the way for future advancements in autonomous robotics, with the ultimate vision of deploying the M4 robot for exploration and rescue tasks, making a significant impact in the quest for intelligent and versatile robotic systems.

Various studies have aimed to clarify the factors that influence the development of user trust. In Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) environments, a critical aspect of trust development is the robot's ability to make its behavior understandable. The concept of an eXplainable Autonomous Robot (XAR) addresses this requirement. However, giving a robot self-explanatory abilities is a complex task. Robot behavior includes multiple skills and diverse subsystems. This complexity led to research into a wide range of methods for generating explanations about robot behavior. This paper presents a systematic literature review that analyzes existing strategies for generating explanations in robots and studies the current XAR trends. Results indicate promising advancements in explainability systems. However, these systems are still unable to fully cover the complex behavior of autonomous robots. Furthermore, we also identify a lack of consensus on the theoretical concept of explainability, and the need for a robust methodology to assess explainability methods and tools has been identified.

Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enabled more capable intelligent automation systems, addressing increasingly complex challenges. However, this progress raises questions about human roles in such systems. Human-Centered AI (HCAI) aims to balance human control and automation, ensuring performance enhancement while maintaining creativity, mastery, and responsibility. For real-world applications, autonomous robots must balance task performance with reliability, safety, and trustworthiness. Integrating HCAI principles enhances human-robot collaboration and ensures responsible operation. This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of intelligent autonomous robotic systems, utilizing SciMAT and VOSViewer to examine data from the Scopus database. The findings highlight academic trends, emerging topics, and AI's role in self-adaptive robotic behaviour, with an emphasis on HCAI architecture. These insights are then projected onto the IBM MAPE-K architecture, with the goal of identifying how these research results map into actual robotic autonomous systems development efforts for real-world scenarios.

Decentralized technologies with blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) are playing a key role. At the same time, advances in deep learning (DL) have significantly raised the degree of autonomy and level of intelligence of robotic and autonomous systems. While these technological revolutions were taking place, raising concerns in terms of data security and end-user privacy has become an inescapable research consideration. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution to privacy-preserving DL at the edge, with an inherently distributed nature by learning on isolated data islands and communicating only model updates. However, FL by itself does not provide the levels of security and robustness required by today's standards in distributed autonomous systems. This survey covers applications of FL to autonomous robots, analyzes the role of DLT and FL for these systems, and introduces the key background concepts and considerations in current research.
