    "expected": {
        "answer": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in human brains. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process and transmit information. Each connection between nodes has an associated weight that adjusts as the network learns. Neural networks are particularly effective at pattern recognition and are widely used in deep learning applications. They can learn to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with task-specific rules.",
