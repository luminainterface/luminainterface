        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>**Introduction**<br><br>The integration of artificial intelligence in criminal justice systems represents a fundamental transformation in legal decision-making processes, raising unprecedented constitutional questions about due process, equal protection, and the preservation of fundamental rights. As AI systems increasingly influence bail determinations, sentencing recommendations, and case analysis, the legal community confronts critical challenges in ensuring these technologies comply with constitutional requirements and uphold justice principles.<br><br>**Constitutional Framework and AI Governance**<br><br>The deployment of AI in legal contexts directly implicates core constitutional provisions, particularly the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires procedural fairness and meaningful opportunity for review, and the Equal Protection Clause, which mandates equal treatment under law. These constitutional requirements create specific obligations for due process, algorithmic transparency, constitutional rights in AI system design and implementation.<br><br>**Legal Challenges in AI Implementation**<br><br>Current AI applications in criminal justice face significant challenges related to due process, algorithmic transparency, constitutional rights, particularly concerning algorithmic transparency, bias detection, and constitutional compliance. The complexity and opacity of AI systems can undermine fundamental legal principles including the right to understand and challenge evidence used in legal proceedings.<br><br>**Research Problem and Constitutional Analysis**<br><br>This research addresses the critical need for legal framework analysis and constitutional review that can ensure AI deployment in criminal justice systems complies with constitutional requirements while maintaining system effectiveness. The work focuses on developing legal and technical frameworks that balance innovation with constitutional protection.<br><br>**Legal Foundation and Analytical Methodology**<br><br>The research employs Constitutional Law, Due Process Theory, Algorithmic Governance to develop systematic approaches for constitutional AI governance. This includes investigating legal precedents, developing compliance frameworks, and creating accountability mechanisms that can ensure constitutional protection in AI-assisted legal proceedings.<br><br>**Research Significance and Justice System Impact**<br><br>The findings contribute to preserving constitutional rights in the digital age by providing practical legal frameworks for responsible AI deployment in criminal justice systems while maintaining public safety and system efficiency objectives.</div>
