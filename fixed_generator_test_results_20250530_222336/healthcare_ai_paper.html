        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>**Introduction**<br><br>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in healthcare represents one of the most transformative technological advances in modern medicine, fundamentally reshaping diagnostic accuracy, treatment personalization, and patient care delivery. However, the deployment of these sophisticated systems has unveiled critical challenges related to algorithmic bias, health equity, diagnostic accuracy, demanding urgent attention from both technical and healthcare policy communities worldwide.<br><br>**Background and Healthcare AI Context**<br><br>Healthcare AI systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across medical imaging, clinical decision support, and personalized treatment recommendation platforms. Leading medical institutions globally have rapidly adopted AI-powered diagnostic tools, with implementations spanning radiology, pathology, dermatology, oncology, and primary care settings. These systems leverage advanced machine learning algorithms trained on vast repositories of medical records, imaging studies, and clinical outcomes to provide evidence-based decision support to healthcare professionals.<br><br>**Critical Challenge: Algorithmic Bias in Medical AI**<br><br>However, mounting empirical evidence suggests that these systems may perpetuate or amplify existing healthcare disparities. Comprehensive studies have documented significant performance variations across demographic groups, with particular concerns about diagnostic accuracy differences affecting racial and ethnic minorities, women, elderly patients, and individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This bias manifestation threatens the fundamental principle of equitable healthcare access.<br><br>**Research Problem and Healthcare Implications**<br><br>The core challenge lies in ensuring that AI systems designed to improve healthcare outcomes do not inadvertently create or exacerbate health inequities. This requires addressing bias at multiple critical levels: data collection and curation protocols, algorithm design and training methodologies, validation and testing procedures, and deployment and monitoring frameworks. The stakes are particularly high in healthcare, where biased AI decisions can directly impact patient health outcomes and life-or-death medical interventions.<br><br>**Research Gap and Clinical Significance**<br><br>Current approaches to algorithmic bias, health equity, diagnostic accuracy often focus on technical solutions without adequately addressing the systemic and structural factors that contribute to biased healthcare outcomes. There exists a critical need for comprehensive frameworks that integrate technical, ethical, regulatory, and implementation considerations to ensure equitable AI deployment in diverse healthcare settings.<br><br>**Novel Contribution and Healthcare Impact**<br><br>This research addresses this gap by proposing a comprehensive bias detection and mitigation frameworks that encompasses the entire AI lifecycle from development through deployment and ongoing clinical evaluation, with specific focus on ensuring equitable healthcare outcomes across all patient populations.</div>
