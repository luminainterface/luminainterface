**Introduction**

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in healthcare represents one of the most transformative technological advances in modern medicine, fundamentally reshaping diagnostic accuracy, treatment personalization, and patient care delivery. However, the deployment of these sophisticated systems has unveiled critical challenges related to {template['key_challenges']}, demanding urgent attention from both technical and healthcare policy communities worldwide.

**Background and Healthcare AI Context**

Healthcare AI systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across medical imaging, clinical decision support, and personalized treatment recommendation platforms. Leading medical institutions globally have rapidly adopted AI-powered diagnostic tools, with implementations spanning radiology, pathology, dermatology, oncology, and primary care settings. These systems leverage advanced machine learning algorithms trained on vast repositories of medical records, imaging studies, and clinical outcomes to provide evidence-based decision support to healthcare professionals.
