# Lumina Neural Network Project - Gap Analysis & Development Path

## Executive Summary
This document provides the initial gap analysis for the Lumina Neural Network System, identifying system weaknesses and outlining a development path to address them. It establishes development priorities in three phases, details implementation paths for key features, and sets evaluation metrics. This serves as the foundation for the extended gap analysis (gapfiller2.md) and guides the implementation efforts tracked in the progress report (gapfiller2_progress.md).
