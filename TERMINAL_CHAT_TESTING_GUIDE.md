## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### High Confidence Tests
Test queries that should result in high confidence scores (>0.7):

```
What is 2 + 2?
Explain basic addition
What is the capital of France?
Define machine learning
```

**Expected**: Green confidence bars, no gap detection

### Low Confidence / Gap Detection Tests
Test queries that should trigger knowledge gap detection and LoRA creation:

```
I don't know about quantum computing
What are the latest AI developments from yesterday?
Explain the ZetaML algorithm
How does quantum-biological computing work?
What happened in the news today?
```

**Expected**: Red confidence bars, gap detection alerts, LoRA requests

### HiRa Steering Tests
Test queries that should benefit from High-Rank Adapter steering:

```
Explain complex machine learning concepts in simple terms
How would you approach a difficult technical problem?
What's the relationship between confidence and learning?
```

**Expected**: "HiRa Steering Applied" indicators

## 📊 Metrics Interpretation

### Confidence Scores
- **🟢 Green (0.8-1.0)**: High confidence, no action needed
- **🟡 Yellow (0.4-0.8)**: Medium confidence, monitoring
- **🔴 Red (0.0-0.4)**: Low confidence, likely to trigger learning

### Response Times
- **🟢 Green (<2.0s)**: Excellent performance
- **🟡 Yellow (2.0-5.0s)**: Acceptable performance
- **🔴 Red (>5.0s)**: May need optimization

### System Health
- **🟢 Green (>80%)**: System operating optimally
- **🟡 Yellow (50-80%)**: Partial functionality
- **🔴 Red (<50%)**: Significant issues

## 🔧 System Diagnostics

The `/diagnostics` command runs automated tests:

1. **High Confidence Validation**
   - Simple math problems
   - Basic factual questions
   - Well-known concepts

2. **Gap Detection Validation**
   - "I don't know" triggers
   - Fictional concepts
   - Time-sensitive information

3. **Learning Pipeline Validation**
   - LoRA creation triggers
   - Knowledge gap classification
   - System integration

4. **Performance Validation**
   - Response time benchmarks
   - Service availability
   - Resource utilization

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

| Metric | Good | Acceptable | Needs Improvement |
|--------|------|------------|-------------------|
| Average Confidence | >0.7 | 0.4-0.7 | <0.4 |
| Response Time | <2s | 2-5s | >5s |
| System Utilization | >80% | 50-80% | <50% |
| Learning Efficiency | >0.3 | 0.1-0.3 | <0.1 |

### Learning Efficiency Calculation
```
Learning Efficiency = Learning Events / Total Conversations
```
- Higher values indicate more responsive learning
- Target: 20-40% for optimal balance

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Services Responding**
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker compose -f docker-compose-v10-ultimate.yml ps

# Restart confidence services
docker compose -f docker-compose-v10-ultimate.yml restart confidence-driven-lora-creator ultimate-chat-orchestrator-with-confidence
```

**Low Confidence Scores Across All Queries**
- Check if confidence calculation is working
- Verify model integration
- Review confidence thresholds

**No LoRA Requests Triggered**
- Lower confidence thresholds in configuration
- Test with explicitly uncertain queries
- Check LoRA creation service status

**HiRa Steering Not Working**
- Verify HiRa service is running (port 9000)
- Check steering configuration
- Review preprocessing logs

## 📝 Session Reports

The terminal interface automatically generates comprehensive session reports:

```json
{
  "session_id": "terminal_session_1234567890",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "metrics": {

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration
Modify `hira_config` in the terminal interface for different steering behaviors:

```python
self.hira_config = {
    'transcript_influence': 0.9,      # Higher = more context-aware
    'pattern_sensitivity': 0.8,       # Higher = more sensitive detection
    'evolution_aggressiveness': 0.7,  # Higher = faster adaptation
    'learning_acceleration': True     # Enable rapid learning
}
```

### Integration Testing
Test integration with specific services:

```bash
# Test specific service chains
curl -X POST http://localhost:8950/chat -d '{"message": "test", "services": ["quantum", "logic", "research"]}'
```

### Performance Profiling
Enable detailed performance tracking:

```python
# Set metrics collection interval
interface.metrics_collection_interval = 5  # seconds
```
