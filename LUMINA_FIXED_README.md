# Lumina v1 UI - Fixed Version

A text-based UI for the Lumina neural network system, built with Python and Textual 3.1.0.

## What Was Fixed

The original Lumina UI implementation faced compatibility issues with Textual 3.1.0. Here's what was fixed:

1. Replaced `TextLog` with `RichLog` which is available in Textual 3.1.0
2. Simplified the UI structure to focus on the core chat interface
3. Added fallback implementations for core components in case imports fail
4. Created a more streamlined UI that matches the visual mockup

## Running the UI

There are two versions you can run:

### Simple Chat-Only Version

```bash
python lumina_run.py
```

This starts the simplified Lumina UI with the core chat interface. It includes:
- Chat input/output
- Memory storage
- Symbol/emotion/breath state tracking

### Full Version (Requires Fixes)

The original UI implementation with all features can be found in `lumina_ui.py`, but might require additional fixes to work with Textual 3.1.0.

## Features in Fixed Version

- **Chat Interface**: Communicate with Lumina through a chat-like interface
- **Memory Tracking**: Conversations are saved to `lumina_memory.jsonl`
- **Special Commands**: Use `:symbol:`, `:emotion:`, and `:breath:` in your messages

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Q` or `ESC`: Quit the application
- `Enter`: Submit text in the chat input

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check `lumina.log` for error messages
2. Ensure Textual 3.1.0 is installed: `pip install textual==3.1.0`
3. Try running with debug: `python lumina_run.py --debug`

## Recommended Next Steps

To implement the full UI with all features from the original design:

1. Gradually add back features (Memory Echoes, Breath Calibration, etc.)
2. Test each feature addition for compatibility with Textual 3.1.0
3. Consult Textual documentation for current API: https://textual.textualize.io/
