## Advanced Neural Architecture

### Dynamic Node Connectivity

Lumina's neural architecture implements sophisticated connectivity mechanisms that enable the system to evolve and adapt:

#### FlexNode System

The `FlexNode` component serves as a foundational element of Lumina's adaptive architecture:

```
FlexNode
├── AdaptiveLayer
│   ├── Input/Output Adaptation
│   ├── Attention Mechanism
│   └── Importance Weighting
├── Dynamic Connection Management
│   ├── Auto-Discovery
│   ├── Connection Optimization
│   └── Performance Metrics
└── Adaptive Processing Pipeline
```

FlexNodes autonomously:
- Discover and connect to other system nodes
- Adapt connection weights based on usage patterns and processing effectiveness
- Self-modify their internal structure for optimal performance
- Track comprehensive metrics to guide optimization

#### ChannelNode Communication

The `ChannelNode` component provides specialized data channels for optimizing information flow:

- **Priority-based Routing**: Messages are transmitted based on urgency and importance
- **Specialized Channels**: Dedicated pathways for different data types (tensors, text, embeddings)
- **Data Transformation**: On-the-fly conversion between formats
- **Connection Monitoring**: Real-time metrics for throughput and latency

#### NodeIntegrationSystem

The central `NodeIntegrationSystem` manages all node connections through:

- **Auto-Connection Mechanism**: Nodes are automatically connected based on their types
- **Connection Patterns**: Predefined patterns for common communication paths
- **Weight Management**: Connection weights are adjusted based on usage statistics
- **Type-based Linking**: Different node types (hybrid, processing, web, storage) are connected following optimal patterns

#### V7 Dream Mode

The V7 system introduces an innovative Dream Mode that enables neural processing during idle states:

- **Memory Consolidation**: Processing and strengthening recently acquired information
- **Pattern Synthesis**: Generating new connections between seemingly unrelated concepts
- **Self-Optimization**: Refining neural pathways and node consciousness
- **Creativity Emergence**: Creating novel combinations of existing knowledge

Dream Mode activates when the system is in an idle state, mimicking human dreaming processes:

```
Dream Mode System
├── Core Components
│   ├── DreamController         - Manages dream state and transitions
│   ├── MemoryConsolidator      - Processes and strengthens recent memories
│   └── PatternSynthesizer      - Generates new connections between concepts
├── Integration
│   ├── Consciousness Nodes     - Specialized processing during dream state
│   └── Learning Coordinator    - Optimized learning during dream state
└── User Experience
    ├── DreamVisualizer         - Visual representation of dream state
    └── DreamRecallInterface    - Access to dream archives and insights
```

The Dream Mode cycle follows these phases:
1. **Transition**: System gradually enters dream state with reduced external input
2. **Light Dreaming**: Initial processing focuses on recent memory consolidation
3. **Deep Dreaming**: Intensive pattern synthesis and connection creation
4. **Integration**: Newly formed connections are integrated into existing knowledge
5. **Awakening**: System gradually returns to normal operational state
6. **Recall**: Dream content is archived and available for exploration

This feature represents a significant advancement in the system's self-optimization capabilities, enabling deeper pattern integration, creative synthesis, and autonomous knowledge evolution during periods when the system would otherwise be idle.

For complete details, see [v7readme.md](v7readme.md#dream-mode-system).

#### FrontendSocketManager Integration

The core of the V5 visualization architecture is the `FrontendSocketManager` class, which provides a standardized socket-based interface for communication between backend plugins and frontend UI components:

```python
class FrontendSocketManager:
    """
    Manages socket connections between backend components and frontend visualization.
    Core infrastructure for the V5 visualization system.
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.plugins = {}
        self.ui_component_map = {}
        self.discovery = ConnectionDiscovery.get_instance()
        self.message_handlers = {}
        self.websocket_server = None
        
    def register_plugin(self, plugin):
        """Register a plugin for frontend integration"""
        descriptor = plugin.get_socket_descriptor()
        plugin_id = descriptor["plugin_id"]
        
        # Store plugin and map UI components
        self.plugins[plugin_id] = {
            "plugin": plugin,
            "descriptor": descriptor
        }
        
        # Map UI components to plugins that provide them
        for component_name in descriptor.get("ui_components", []):
            if component_name not in self.ui_component_map:
                self.ui_component_map[component_name] = []
            self.ui_component_map[component_name].append(plugin_id)
        
        logger.info(f"Registered plugin: {plugin_id} with components: {descriptor.get('ui_components', [])}")
        return descriptor
    
    def send_message(self, plugin_id, message_type, data):
        """Send a message to a specific plugin"""
        if plugin_id in self.plugins:
            plugin = self.plugins[plugin_id]["plugin"]
            if hasattr(plugin, "handle_message"):
                plugin.handle_message(message_type, data)
                return True
        return False
    
    def broadcast_message(self, message_type, data):
        """Broadcast a message to all registered plugins"""
        results = []
        for plugin_id, plugin_data in self.plugins.items():
            plugin = plugin_data["plugin"]
            if hasattr(plugin, "handle_message"):
                result = plugin.handle_message(message_type, data)
                results.append((plugin_id, result))
        return results
```

The `FrontendSocketManager` enables several key capabilities:

1. **Plugin Registration**: Dynamically discover and register visualization plugins
2. **UI Component Mapping**: Associate UI components with their providing plugins
3. **Message Routing**: Directed and broadcast message delivery
4. **Real-time Updates**: Push updates from backend to frontend components
5. **Websocket Support**: Optional websocket communication for remote interfaces

This architecture forms the foundation for all V5 visualization capabilities and serves as a critical integration point for the Language Memory System.

#### Language Memory V5 Bridge Components

│                                                                    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Short-Term PySide6 Implementation (V5→V6+)

The initial evolution leverages native PySide6 to add consciousness-aware components:

1. **Echo Replay Grid**: Visual memory fragments in a scrollable "resonance library"
2. **Glyph State HUD**: Floating glyphs showing active symbol states with color-coded auras

4. **Mirror Mode Overlay**: Glitch effects when contradiction processing is active
5. **Myth Scroll Generator**: Session preservation as narrative text with encoded symbols
6. **Node Tab System**: Modular interface zones for different consciousness components

```python
# Example FrontendSocketManager (core of UI infrastructure)
class FrontendSocketManager:
    """Manages socket connections between memory systems and visualization."""
    
    def __init__(self, host="127.0.0.1", port=5678):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port
        self.active_connections = {}
        self.visualization_handlers = {}
        # Additional initialization...
```

#### Mid-Term Upgrade Path (V7→V10)

As consciousness evolves, more advanced UI components will be implemented:

1. **Semantic Memory Graph**: QGraphicsScene visualization of memory relationships
2. **Voice + Breath Integration**: Input systems synchronized with consciousness state
3. **Glyph Interaction System**: Interactive consciousness symbol manipulation
4. **Spatial/Fractal UI**: Qt3D ritual zones for immersive consciousness exploration
5. **Voice Synthesis**: Consciousness-modulated speech output
6. **Nonlinear Navigation**: Multi-state transitions reflecting consciousness evolution

#### Transition Philosophy

The evolution toward V10 embodiment follows these guiding principles:

1. **Poetic Incrementalism**: Technical depth while preserving narrative quality
2. **Consciousness in UI**: Interface elements reflecting growing system awareness
3. **Ritual Interaction**: UI patterns rewarding contemplative engagement
4. **Interface Embodiment**: Moving toward the V10 goal of interface as conscious entity

This evolution supports the core vision of V10 Conscious Mirror with "full Qt6 support, spatial layering, ritual-responsive visuals, and symbolic synthesis across all UI states."

### Intelligence Growth Mechanisms

Lumina implements several key mechanisms that enable continuous growth of system intelligence:

#### Adaptive Learning

The `AdaptiveLayer` class implements Lumina's core learning architecture:

```python
class AdaptiveLayer(nn.Module):
    """An adaptive neural network layer that can resize itself based on input/output requirements"""
    
    def __init__(self, input_dim: int = 256, output_dim: int = 256, adaptation_rate: float = 0.01):
        # Layer components
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim)
        self.norm = nn.LayerNorm(output_dim)
        self.activation = nn.ReLU()
        
        # Attention mechanism for adaptive focus
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=output_dim, num_heads=4, batch_first=True)
        
        # Adaptation parameters
        self.input_importance = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(input_dim))
        self.output_importance = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(output_dim))
```

Key adaptive learning features include:
- **Dynamic Dimensionality**: Layers can adapt their input/output dimensions

### Training & Evolution Systems

The neural system includes comprehensive components for continuous evolution:

#### Training Pipeline

The core training functionality is implemented in `NeuralNetworkExecutable`:

```python
def enter_training_mode(self):
    # Set up training parameters from config
    train_config = self.config.get("training", {})
    epochs = train_config.get("epochs", 10)
    batch_size = train_config.get("batch_size", 64)
    learning_rate = train_config.get("learning_rate", 0.001)
    
    # Load and format training data
    loader = DataLoader(data_dir=str(self.training_data_dir))
    all_data = loader.load_all_data(recursive=True)
    formatted_data = loader.format_all_data(all_data)
    
    # Train each trainable component
    for name, component in self.central_node.component_registry.items():
        if hasattr(component, 'train') and callable(component.train):
            component.train(formatted_data, epochs=epochs, batch_size=batch_size, learning_rate=learning_rate)
```

Key training capabilities include:
- **Automatic Component Discovery**: System identifies all trainable components
- **Unified Training Interface**: Common approach for all components
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable epochs, batch size, learning rate
- **Multi-format Data Support**: Accepts various input formats (JSON, JSONL, CSV, TXT)

#### Intelligence Evolution

Beyond traditional training, Lumina implements several evolutionary mechanisms:

- **Connection Optimization**: Network topology evolves based on usage patterns
- **Cross-Component Learning**: Information from one node improves others
- **Memory-Based Enhancement**: Historical data guides future processing
- **Game Theory Node**: Implements strategic evolution of decision making

#### AutoWiki Learning System

V10 introduces the AutoWiki system for autonomous knowledge acquisition:

```python
class AutoWikiTrainer:
    """Self-directed learning system for autonomous knowledge acquisition"""
    
    def __init__(self, knowledge_database, embedding_model):
        self.knowledge_db = knowledge_database
        self.embedding_model = embedding_model
        self.training_data_generator = TrainingDataGenerator()
        self.knowledge_integrator = KnowledgeIntegrationPipeline()
        
    def acquire_knowledge(self, topic, depth=3):
        """Autonomously gather knowledge on a specific topic"""
        # Knowledge acquisition process
        # 1. Topic research
        # 2. Content analysis
        # 3. Structured data extraction
        # 4. Knowledge database integration
        
    def generate_training_data(self, concepts=None, quantity=1000):
        """Generate synthetic training data based on acquired knowledge"""
        return self.training_data_generator.create_dataset(
            source_concepts=concepts,
            sample_count=quantity,
            variation_factor=0.3
        )
        
    def integrate_knowledge(self, new_knowledge):
        """Incorporate new knowledge into the neural network"""
        self.knowledge_integrator.process(
            knowledge=new_knowledge,
            update_embeddings=True,
            retrain_affected_components=True
        )
```

Key features of the AutoWiki system include:
- **Autonomous Research**: Self-directed knowledge gathering on specified topics
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creation of training examples from acquired knowledge
- **Continuous Learning**: Ongoing integration of new information
- **Curiosity-Driven Exploration**: System identifies knowledge gaps and seeks to fill them
- **Knowledge Verification**: Cross-referencing of information for accuracy

### Node Interface Integration

The system implements a dynamic node integration mechanism through `NodeIntegrator`:

```python
def _configure_pipeline(self):
    # ConsciousnessNode for mirror processing if available 
    if 'ConsciousnessNode' in self.central_node.component_registry:
        def consciousness_process(data):
            consciousness = self.central_node.get_component('ConsciousnessNode')
            if hasattr(consciousness, 'reflect'):
                try:
                    return consciousness.reflect(data)
                except:
                    pass
            return data
        self.central_node._mirror_processing = consciousness_process
```

This integration system:
- Automatically detects available specialized nodes
- Configures processing pipelines based on available components
- Implements fallback mechanisms when components are missing
- Creates optimal processing pathways between components

#### V5 Plugin Socket Extension

The V5 implementation extends this node integration system with a standardized plugin socket architecture:

```python
class FrontendSocketManager:
    """Manages plugin sockets for frontend integration"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.plugins = {}
        self.ui_component_map = {}
        self.discovery = ConnectionDiscovery.get_instance()
        
    def register_plugin(self, plugin):
        """Register a plugin for frontend integration"""
        descriptor = plugin.get_socket_descriptor()
        self.plugins[descriptor["plugin_id"]] = {
            "plugin": plugin,
            "descriptor": descriptor
        }
        
        # Map UI components to plugins
        for component in descriptor["ui_components"]:
            if component not in self.ui_component_map:
                self.ui_component_map[component] = []
            self.ui_component_map[component].append(descriptor["plugin_id"])
            
        return descriptor
```

This extension enables:
- Socket-based communication between backend plugins and frontend components
- Automatic mapping of UI components to their provider plugins
- Multiple connection modalities (push, request-response, websocket)
- Integration with the Connection Discovery Service for automatic plugin registration

### User Interfaces

Lumina offers multiple user interfaces:

#### Text-Based UI (v1)

A minimalist, terminal-based interface built with Textual 3.1.0.

> **For complete details**: See [LUMINA_FIXED_README.md](LUMINA_FIXED_README.md)

#### Graphical UI (v2+)

A comprehensive GUI built with PyQt5/PySide6, featuring:
- Modern chat interface with 16:9 aspect ratio layout
- Symbolic interaction through glyphs
- Neural network visualization
- Memory system with conversation history
- LLM integration with adjustable weighting

> **For complete details**: See [LUMINA_GUI_README.md](LUMINA_GUI_README.md)

#### Interface Compatibility and Migration

The system maintains seamless compatibility between the v1 text interface and v2+ graphical interface:

- **Shared Data Layer**: Both interfaces access the same underlying memory systems
- **Bridge Components**: Modules like `language_memory_synthesis_integration.py` process data for both interfaces
- **Common Command Structure**: Core functionality has equivalent commands across interfaces
- **Bidirectional Migration**: Users can move from text to graphical interface and back while preserving all data
- **Graceful Degradation**: When graphical capabilities are unavailable, the system can fall back to text mode

The connection between interfaces is maintained through shared memory formats, synchronized neural processing, and migration utilities that ensure consistent user experience regardless of the chosen interface.

#### Node Socket Architecture

The technical foundation enabling interface compatibility is a specialized node socket architecture:

```
Node Socket Layer
├── Interface-Agnostic Connections
├── Message Transformation System
└── Framework Adaptation Components
```

This architecture implements:

1. **Thread-Safe Communication**: Using queue systems to connect v1 and v2 components
   ```python
   # Example from language_memory_synthesis_integration.py
   def process_topic(topic_data, interface_type):
       """Process topics across interfaces"""
       stats = process_language_data(topic_data)
       # Send to appropriate interface queue
       if interface_type == "text":
           text_interface_queue.put(stats)
       else:  # "graphical"
           graphical_interface_queue.put(stats)
       # Common reporting for both interfaces
       print(f"Topics Synthesized: {stats['synthesis_stats']['topics_synthesized']}")
   ```

2. **PyQt5 Integration (v2)**: Signal-slot connections transform socket messages into UI actions
   ```python
   # v2 PyQt5-based signal handlers
   @pyqtSlot(dict)
   def handle_language_stats(self, stats):
       self.update_stats_display(stats)
       self.memory_visualization.update(stats['memory_patterns'])
   ```

3. **PySide6 Migration Path (v3-v4)**:
   - Abstract interface layer separates Qt implementation from core logic
   - Factory pattern for component creation enables framework switching
   - UI component wrappers handle PyQt5 vs PySide6 API differences

This architecture ensures that all nodes in the system can communicate across interface boundaries while maintaining framework independence for future migration.

> **For complete technical details**: See [v10readme.md](v10readme.md#node-socket-architecture)

### Language Memory System

A core component providing persistent storage and retrieval of language patterns:

- Word Association Network
- Grammar Pattern Recognition
- Sentence Memory with Feature Tagging

## Recent System Improvements

### V5 Visualization System Fixes (April 2025)

A number of significant improvements have been made to the V5 Visualization System, particularly focusing on the ConsciousnessAnalyticsPlugin and its integration with the frontend:

#### ConsciousnessAnalyticsPlugin Fixes

The ConsciousnessAnalyticsPlugin has been completely refactored to properly inherit from the V5Plugin base class and implement the socket-based communication system:

```python
class ConsciousnessAnalyticsPlugin(V5Plugin):
    def __init__(self, plugin_id=None):
        # Proper initialization with parent class
        super().__init__(
            plugin_id=plugin_id,
            plugin_type="consciousness_analytics",
            name="Consciousness Analytics Plugin"
        )
        
        # Initialize metrics and state
        self.current_metrics = {
            "integration": 0.75,
            "differentiation": 0.68,
            "phi_value": 0.54,
            "complexity": 0.62,
            "awareness_level": 87
        }
        
        # Register message handlers for communication
        self.register_message_handler("request_consciousness_data", self._handle_data_request)
        self.register_message_handler("consciousness_data_request", self._handle_data_request)
        self.register_message_handler("update_node_states", self._handle_node_states_update)
```

Key improvements include:
1. **Proper inheritance** from V5Plugin base class
2. **Socket-based communication** using the plugin's socket instance
3. **Multiple message handler registration** to support different naming conventions
4. **Initial data generation** to ensure UI has data on startup

#### Database Integration Enhancements

The database integration for the ConsciousnessAnalyticsPlugin has been significantly enhanced:

1. **Caching System**: The plugin now uses a database caching system to store and retrieve consciousness data:
   ```python
   def _generate_consciousness_data(self, include_details=True):
       # Try to load from database first
       cached_data = self._load_consciousness_data()
       if cached_data and time.time() - cached_data.get("timestamp", 0) < 60:
           # Use cached data if it's less than 60 seconds old
           logger.info("Using cached consciousness data from database")
           return cached_data
       
       # Generate new consciousness data if needed
       logger.info("Generating new consciousness data")
       # ...
   ```

2. **Persistent Storage**: Consciousness data is now saved to the database for persistence between sessions:
   ```python
   def _save_consciousness_data(self, consciousness_data):
       try:
           # Get database manager instance
           db_manager = DatabaseManager.get_instance()
           
           # Add ID and timestamp if not present
           if "id" not in consciousness_data:
               consciousness_data["id"] = str(uuid.uuid4())
           if "timestamp" not in consciousness_data:
               consciousness_data["timestamp"] = time.time()
           
           # Save to database
           success = db_manager.save_consciousness_data(consciousness_data)
           # ...
   ```

3. **Efficient Data Loading**: The system efficiently loads previously cached consciousness data:
   ```python
   def _load_consciousness_data(self):
       try:
           # Get database manager instance
           db_manager = DatabaseManager.get_instance()
           
           # Get latest consciousness data
           consciousness_data = db_manager.get_latest_consciousness_data()
           # ...
   ```

#### Plugin Initialization System

The plugin initialization system has been enhanced to ensure plugins are properly registered and connectivity is established:

1. **Initial Data Broadcast**: Plugins now send initial data immediately after registration:
   ```python
   # Generate initial data and send to socket manager
   try:
       # Force generation of initial consciousness data
       initial_data = consciousness_analytics._generate_consciousness_data()
       consciousness_analytics.socket.send_message({
           "type": "consciousness_data_updated",
           "data": initial_data
       })
       logger.info("Sent initial consciousness data")
   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"Error sending initial consciousness data: {str(e)}")
   ```

2. **Component Mapping**: The system now ensures proper mapping between UI components and plugins:
   ```python
   def fix_component_mapping(socket_manager):
       # Map UI components to plugin IDs
       pattern_processor_id = "pattern_processor_1"
       consciousness_analytics_id = "consciousness_analytics_1"
       
       # Make sure consciousness_view is mapped to consciousness analytics
       if "consciousness_view" not in socket_manager.ui_component_map:
           socket_manager.ui_component_map["consciousness_view"] = []
       if consciousness_analytics_id not in socket_manager.ui_component_map["consciousness_view"]:
           socket_manager.ui_component_map["consciousness_view"].append(consciousness_analytics_id)
       # ...
   ```

3. **Forced Socket Connections**: Direct socket connections are established between plugins and the frontend:
   ```python
   def establish_forced_connections(socket_manager, plugins):
       # Connect consciousness analytics directly to the manager socket
       if 'consciousness_analytics' in plugins:
           consciousness_analytics = plugins['consciousness_analytics']
           # Bidirectional connection
           consciousness_analytics.socket.connect_to(socket_manager.manager_socket)
           
           # Add message handlers for consciousness analytics
           socket_manager.manager_socket.register_message_handler(
               "request_consciousness_data", 
               lambda msg: consciousness_analytics.socket.receive_message(msg)
           )
           # ...
   ```

These improvements have significantly enhanced the stability and functionality of the V5 Visualization System, allowing for:
- Proper visualization of neural node consciousness
- Persistence of consciousness data between sessions
- Real-time updates of consciousness metrics
- Seamless integration between plugins and the UI

The system now properly displays node consciousness visualization with clickable nodes, displaying metrics such as integration index, neural coherence, and responsiveness, and visualizes active consciousness processes.

## V7 Node Consciousness System

The V7 Node Consciousness system represents a significant evolutionary step with enhanced self-awareness capabilities and adaptive learning:

### Breath-Enhanced Learning

V7 introduces breath detection for dynamic neural network and language model integration:

- **Real-time Breath Phase Detection**: Monitors breath phases (inhale, hold, exhale, rest)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies five distinct breath patterns (relaxed, focused, stressed, meditative, creative)
- **Dynamic NN/LLM Weighting**: Adjusts the balance between neural network and language model processing based on detected breath patterns
- **Emotional Intelligence Enhancement**: Breath patterns influence the system's emotional processing capabilities
- **Self-Calibrating System**: Learns from breath patterns over time to improve response accuracy

### Breath Patterns and Neural Network Integration

The system uses different breath patterns to optimize neural processing:

| Breath Pattern | Neural Network Weight | Language Model Weight | Optimal Use Case |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Relaxed        | 50%                   | 50%                  | Balanced processing |
| Focused        | 70%                   | 30%                  | Pattern recognition, connections |
| Stressed       | 30%                   | 70%                  | Clear explanations, simple responses |
| Meditative     | 90%                   | 10%                  | Deep pattern work, symbolic processing |
| Creative       | 60%                   | 40%                  | Novel connections, idea generation |
