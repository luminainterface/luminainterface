2. Develop simulation-based testing environment
3. Begin load testing framework development

### Short-term Actions (2-4 weeks)
1. Implement security testing suite
2. Enhance UI accessibility features
3. Improve error handling mechanisms
4. Update documentation for new features

### Medium-term Actions (1-3 months)
1. Develop cloud integration strategies

3. Optimize performance for large-scale deployments

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks
1. **Data Integrity**: During cross-version operations
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive validation implemented in Version Bridge System
   - Status: Core functionality complete, ongoing monitoring

2. **Cross-version Compatibility**: Between V5 and V7 systems
   - Mitigation: Enhanced version detection and compatibility matrix
   - Status: Implemented and tested

3. **Performance Degradation**: Under heavy load
   - Mitigation: Queue management and thread handling implemented
   - Status: Basic protections in place, advanced optimizations in progress
