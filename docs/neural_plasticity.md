# Neural Plasticity Module

## Overview
The Neural Plasticity Module is a core component of the Lumina Neural Network v9 architecture, implementing biologically-inspired learning mechanisms that allow for dynamic adaptation of neural connections based on activity patterns. This module serves as the foundation for the system's ability to learn, adapt, and evolve in response to inputs and experiences.

## Key Features

### 1. Hebbian Learning Implementation
- **Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)**
  - Modifies synaptic strengths based on the relative timing of pre- and post-synaptic neuronal spikes
  - Implements causal relationship detection between neurons
  - Temporal window parameters for potentiation and depression adjustable via configuration

- **Covariance-Based Plasticity**
  - Strengthens connections between neurons that consistently fire together
  - Implements the classic "neurons that fire together, wire together" principle
  - Includes decay mechanisms for connections that don't demonstrate correlated activity

### 2. Synaptic Weight Dynamics

- **Weight Boundaries**
  - Configurable minimum and maximum weight values
  - Soft boundaries using logistic functions to prevent abrupt saturation
  - Scaling factors for different neural regions

- **Metaplasticity**
  - History-dependent modification of plastic change
  - Sliding threshold for LTP/LTD based on recent activity
  - Prevents runaway potentiation/depression cycles

- **Short-term Dynamics**
  - Synaptic facilitation and depression mechanisms
  - Resource depletion and recovery models
  - Time constants configurable per neural region

### 3. Homeostatic Regulation Mechanisms
