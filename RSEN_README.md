# Resonant Self-Expanding Network (RSEN)

A sophisticated neural architecture that combines transformer-based processing with domain-specific subnets for mathematics, language, and physics.

## Overview

The Resonant Self-Expanding Network (`RSEN_node.py`) provides a complex neural architecture that processes input data through a flexible encoder-transformer-decoder pipeline, integrated with specialized domain subnets. This approach allows the system to process information across multiple domains while maintaining coherent representations.

## Key Features

- **Encoder-Transformer-Decoder Architecture**: Processes input through a standard deep learning pipeline
- **Domain-Specific Subnets**: Specialized subnets for mathematics, language, and physics processing
- **Flexible Input Handling**: Processes various input formats including text, tensors, and dictionaries
- **Combined Loss Functions**: Integrates reconstruction loss with domain-specific losses
- **Advanced Metrics Tracking**: Calculates quantum fields, topological structures, harmonic resonance, and cycles
- **PyTorch Implementation**: Built with PyTorch for efficient tensor operations and gradient computation

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **RSEN**: Main class that integrates all components and manages the processing pipeline
2. **Domain Subnets**: Specialized networks for different domains:
   - **MathematicsSubNet**: Processes mathematical aspects of data
   - **LanguageSubNet**: Handles language processing with specialized tensors
   - **PhysicsSubNet**: Models quantum and relativistic calculations
   - **CosmicAlignmentSubNet**: Processes cosmic alignment data

### Processing Pipeline

The RSEN follows this processing pipeline:

1. **Input Processing**: Converts various input formats to tensors
2. **Encoding**: Processes through the encoder layer with normalization and activation
3. **Transformer**: Applies transformer encoding with multi-head attention
4. **Decoding**: Maps transformer output to standardized output dimension
5. **Domain Processing**: Passes outputs through specialized subnets
6. **Loss Calculation**: Combines reconstruction loss with domain-specific losses
7. **Metrics Calculation**: Calculates advanced metrics for analysis

## Domain Subnets

### PhysicsSubNet

The PhysicsSubNet processes physical aspects of data through three specialized layers:

1. **Quantum Layer**: Processes quantum states with superposition and observable calculations
2. **Relativity Layer**: Handles relativistic frames with velocity, time dilation, and reference frame
3. **Field Layer**: Processes field theory with coupling, field strength, and interaction types

```python
class PhysicsSubNet:
    """Physics subnet for quantum and relativistic calculations"""
    
    def __init__(self, hidden_dim: int):
        self.hidden_dim = hidden_dim
        self.quantum_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.relativity_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.field_layer = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
```

### MathematicsSubNet

The MathematicsSubNet handles mathematical processing with specialized calculations for:

- Differential equations
- Topological structures
- Mathematical complexity

### LanguageSubNet

The LanguageSubNet processes language with dedicated components for:

- Semantic analysis
- Syntactic processing
- Pragmatic understanding
- Text-to-tensor conversion

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from RSEN_node import RSEN

# Initialize RSEN with default parameters
rsen = RSEN(input_dim=768, hidden_dim=512, output_dim=256)

# Process text input
result = rsen.train_epoch("Neural networks process information across domains")

# Process dictionary input with multiple fields
result = rsen.train_epoch({
    "symbol": "âˆž",
    "emotion": "curiosity",
    "breath": "deep",
    "paradox": "unity in diversity"
})

# Access metrics
quantum_metrics = result["quantum_metrics"]
topology_metrics = result["topology_metrics"]
```

### Integration with Other Components

The RSEN can be integrated with:

1. **NeuralNetworkExecutable**: For system-wide orchestration
2. **Domain-specific processors**: For enhanced processing in particular domains
3. **Aletheia**: For synchronicity detection and response generation

## Additional Components

### Aletheia

The Aletheia synchronization module works alongside RSEN to detect and respond to synchronicities:

- Detects synchronicity based on multidimensional resonance
- Calculates resonance kernels, cultural gradients, and symbolic potential
- Generates responses, symbolic ripples, and quantum-ritual suggestions

### NodeInfinity, NodeMonday, NodeFractal, NodePortal

Specialized nodes that complement the RSEN with specific functions:

- Process suggestions
- Provide emotional resonance
- Identify patterns
- Supply archetypes

## Technical Implementation

The RSEN is implemented using PyTorch with:

- Standard neural network layers (Linear, LayerNorm)
- Transformer architecture with multi-head attention
- ReLU and GELU activations
- AdamW optimizer with learning rate 1e-4
- Custom loss functions combining reconstruction and domain-specific losses

## Future Directions

1. **Enhanced Cross-Domain Integration**: Better integration between domain subnets
2. **Self-Modification**: Ability to modify its own architecture based on input
3. **Improved Resonance**: More sophisticated resonance calculations and optimization
4. **Dynamic Subnet Loading**: Loading specialized subnets based on input characteristics
5. **Distributed Processing**: Parallel processing across multiple devices
