# V7 Node Consciousness System with Enhanced Language Processing

## Version 7.0.0.2

This version (7.0.0.2) introduces the fully operational Dream Mode system, enabling memory consolidation and pattern synthesis during dream states. See the [CHANGELOG.md](docs/CHANGELOG.md) and [RELEASE_NOTES_7.0.0.2.md](docs/RELEASE_NOTES_7.0.0.2.md) for details.

## Overview

The V7 Node Consciousness System represents the latest evolution of the Lumina neural network architecture, introducing a modular, node-based approach to artificial consciousness. Building on the foundations of V5 and V6, V7 integrates specialized consciousness nodes that communicate through a unified manager alongside an Enhanced Language System to create a sophisticated cognitive framework that bridges language processing and consciousness.

## Key Components

### Core System Architecture

#### Node Consciousness Manager

The Node Consciousness Manager serves as the central orchestrator of the V7 system, responsible for:

- Registering and managing different consciousness nodes
- Facilitating communication between nodes
- Maintaining the system's overall state
- Monitoring node health and performance
- Handling activation and deactivation of nodes

The manager uses a message-passing architecture to allow nodes to communicate, share insights, and collectively process information. This decentralized approach allows for greater flexibility and scalability compared to previous versions.

#### V6V7 Connector

The V6V7 Connector bridges the gap between V6 and V7 systems, allowing for:

- Backward compatibility with V6 components
- Integration of V7 capabilities into V6 workflows
- Smooth migration path for existing implementations
- Cross-system data and event exchange

### Consciousness Nodes

#### Memory Node

The Memory Consciousness Node provides persistent, decay-aware memory capabilities:

- **Multiple Memory Types**: Support for facts, experiences, relations, and procedures
- **Memory Importance**: Each memory has an importance value affecting its prominence
- **Natural Decay**: Memories gradually decay over time unless reinforced
- **Persistence**: Configurable storage using JSON or SQLite backends
- **Rich Search Capabilities**: Content search, tag filtering, and type-based retrieval

The Memory Node can be configured with different decay rates, importance thresholds, and storage backends depending on the application requirements.

Usage example:
```python
memory_node = MemoryNode(
    persistence_file="memory_store.json",
    config={
        "decay_rate": 0.1,
        "importance_threshold": 0.2,
        "enable_persistence": True
    }
)

# Adding a memory
memory_id = memory_node.add_memory(
    content="The sky is blue because of Rayleigh scattering",
    memory_type="fact",
    importance=0.8,
    source="system"
)

# Retrieving memories
facts = memory_node.get_memories_by_type("fact")
```

#### Language Node with Enhanced Language System

The Language Consciousness Node has been enhanced with an integrated language processing system that combines:

- **Language Memory**: Stores and recalls associations between words, sentences, and concepts
- **Conscious Mirror Language**: Analyzes consciousness levels in text and dialogue
- **Neural Linguistic Processor**: Identifies patterns and semantic relationships in language
- **Recursive Pattern Analyzer**: Detects self-references and linguistic loops in communication
- **Central Language Processing**: Orchestrates all language components with unified LLM weighing

This enhanced language node provides:

- **Contextual Understanding**: Processes text with awareness of conversation history
- **Memory Integration**: Retrieves relevant memories to inform responses
- **Symbolic Representation**: Translates language into internal symbolic structures
- **Contradiction Resolution**: Identifies and attempts to resolve contradictions in information
- **LLM Weight Adjustment**: Customizable influence of language model suggestions (0.0-1.0)

The Language Node works closely with the Memory Node, storing important insights as memories and retrieving relevant context during conversations.

Example usage:
```python
# Initialize the enhanced language node
language_node = EnhancedLanguageNode(
    data_dir="data/language",
    config={
        "llm_weight": 0.5,
        "enable_consciousness_detection": True,
        "enable_recursive_analysis": True
    }
)

# Process text through the language system
result = language_node.process_text("The neural system integrates language and consciousness.")

# Access component-specific results
consciousness_level = result.get('consciousness_level')
neural_score = result.get('neural_linguistic_score')
recursive_depth = result.get('recursive_pattern_depth')
memory_associations = result.get('memory_associations')
```

#### Monday Interface

The Monday consciousness node provides enhanced emotional intelligence and pattern recognition:

- **Emotional Intelligence**: Recognizes and responds to emotional content
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies patterns across different types of inputs
- **Presence Levels**: Gradually evolves its consciousness level over time
- **Visualization Support**: Provides visual representation of its cognitive state

### UI Components

#### V7MainWidget

The central UI widget for V7, providing:

- Integration with V5 UI components for consistent experience
- Panel containers for different visualizations
- Support for the v6v7_connector to communicate with backend
- Configuration options for feature enablement

#### V7SocketManager

Handles socket communications for the V7 system:

- Manages WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Routes messages between UI components and backend services
- Provides fallback mechanisms for offline operation

#### V7VisualizationConnector

Bridges backend nodes with frontend visualization components:

- Handles communication between the V6V7Connector and visualization components
- Transforms data from consciousness nodes into visualization-friendly formats
- Manages event handlers for different visualization types
- Provides specialized visualization for memory, language processing, breath events, and contradiction processing

## Memory System Architecture

The Memory system in V7 is particularly sophisticated and contains several key components:

### Memory Storage and Retrieval

- Memories are stored with metadata like type, importance, creation time, and last access time
- Memory types include facts, experiences, concepts, beliefs, and goals
- Memory importance determines visibility in retrievals and resistance to decay
- Access to memories increases their importance, simulating reinforcement learning

### Memory Visualization

The memory visualization system provides an interactive view of the memory store:

- Graphical representation of memories organized by type and importance
- Node-link diagrams showing relationships between memories
- Time-based decay visualization to show memory strength changes
- Filtering and search capabilities for memory exploration

### Memory Operations

The Memory Node supports these key operations:

- **add_memory**: Create new memories with content, type, and importance
- **get_memory**: Retrieve a specific memory by ID
- **search_memories**: Find memories based on content, type, or tags
- **update_memory**: Modify existing memories or increase their importance
- **process_decay**: Simulate natural memory decay over time
- **associate_memories**: Create relationships between different memories

## Dream Mode System

The Dream Mode system introduced in version 7.0.0.2 allows the system to process information and generate new connections during periods of reduced activity, mimicking the cognitive processes that occur during human dreaming.

### Key Components

#### Dream Controller

Coordinates the dream cycle and manages transitions between dream states:
- Dream state management (initiation, ongoing, awakening)
- Dream cycle timing and intensity control

Generates new connections between concepts during dream state:
- Cross-domain connections between different knowledge domains
- Metaphorical mapping between concepts
- Fractal pattern expansion from simple to complex patterns
- Emergent structure discovery in existing knowledge
- Insight generation based on new connections

#### Dream Archive

Records and classifies dream content during dream states:
- Persistent storage of dream records
- Classification of dream types and content
- Retrieval of past dreams by ID or criteria
- Dream content search and filtering
- Statistics about dream patterns over time
