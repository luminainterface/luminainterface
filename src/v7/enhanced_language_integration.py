"""
Enhanced Language Integration System for V7

This module integrates language models with the neural network system,
providing enhanced language processing capabilities.

Features:
- Text processing with consciousness level measurement
- Neural-linguistic score analysis
- Recursive pattern depth detection
- Streaming text generation for interactive UI experiences
- Mock mode for development and testing without dependencies
- Adjustable weights for neural network and language model components
- System metrics tracking and background updates

The streaming implementation uses callbacks and threading to progressively 
deliver text chunks and updated metrics, enabling dynamic UI feedback.
