## Getting Started

To use the Neural Playground in your project:

```python
from src.v9.neural_playground import NeuralPlayground
from src.v9.neural_playground_integration import NeuralPlaygroundIntegration

# Create a basic playground
playground = NeuralPlayground(neuron_count=100)

# Run a simple play session
result = playground.play(
    duration=100,  # Number of time steps
    play_type="free",  # Options: free, guided, focused, mixed
    intensity=0.7  # Intensity of neural stimulation (0.0-1.0)
)

print(f"Play session completed:")
print(f"- Pattern count: {result['patterns_detected']}")
print(f"- Peak consciousness: {result['consciousness_peak']:.2f}")
```

## Integration Example

To integrate the Neural Playground with other components:

```python
from src.v9.neural_playground_integration import NeuralPlaygroundIntegration
from your_component_module import YourNeuralCore, YourMemorySystem

# Create integration manager
integration = NeuralPlaygroundIntegration()

# Register your components
integration.integrate_neural_core(YourNeuralCore())
integration.integrate_memory_system(YourMemorySystem())

# Run an integrated play session
result = integration.run_integrated_play_session(
    duration=200,
    play_type="mixed",
    intensity=0.8
)
```

## Component Integration

The Neural Playground can be integrated with the following component types:

1. **Neural Core Components** - Basic neural processing units
   ```python
   integration.integrate_neural_core(neural_core, connection_strength=0.7)
   ```

2. **Memory Systems** - Store and retrieve neural patterns
   ```python
   integration.integrate_memory_system(memory_system)
   ```

3. **Language Processors** - Generate narratives about neural activity
   ```python
   integration.integrate_language_processor(language_processor)
   ```

4. **Visualization Systems** - Create visual representations of neural activity
   ```python
   integration.integrate_visualization_system(visualization_system)
   ```

5. **Breathing System** - Influence neural activity with breathing patterns
   ```python
   from src.v9.breathing_system import BreathingSystem, BreathingPattern
   
   # Create breathing system with a specific pattern
   breathing = BreathingSystem(default_pattern=BreathingPattern.CALM)
   breathing.start_simulation()
   
   # Set up integration with playground
   integration_info = breathing.integrate_with_playground(playground)
   
   # Register integration hooks
   for hook_name, hook_func in integration_info["hooks"].items():
       integration.integration_hooks[hook_name].append(hook_func)
   ```

## Running Tests

To run the included tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m src.v9.test_neural_playground

# Run specific test type
python -m src.v9.test_neural_playground --test basic

# Run with custom parameters
python -m src.v9.test_neural_playground --neurons 200 --duration 500 --save
```

## Mirror Consciousness

The Mirror Consciousness module provides self-reflection capabilities:

```python
from src.v9.mirror_consciousness import get_mirror_consciousness

# Get singleton instance
mirror = get_mirror_consciousness()

# Reflect on text
reflection = mirror.reflect_on_text(
    "Neural patterns formed during play session",
    {"consciousness_level": 0.75}
)

print(reflection["reflection"])
```

## Breathing System

The Breathing System module simulates different breathing patterns and can influence neural activity:

```python
from src.v9.breathing_system import BreathingSystem, BreathingPattern

# Create breathing system with a specific pattern
breathing = BreathingSystem(default_pattern=BreathingPattern.MEDITATIVE)

# Start simulation
breathing.start_simulation()

# Change breathing pattern
breathing.set_breathing_pattern(BreathingPattern.FOCUSED)

# Get current breath state
state = breathing.get_current_breath_state()
print(f"Breath state: {state['state']}")
print(f"Breath amplitude: {state['amplitude']:.2f}")
print(f"Breath rate: {state['rate']:.1f} breaths/min")

# Visualize breathing data
viz_data = breathing.visualize_breathing(30.0)  # Last 30 seconds

# Influence neural activity directly
influenced = breathing.influence_neural_activation(playground.core)
print(f"Influenced {influenced} neurons based on breathing")

# Stop simulation when done
breathing.stop_simulation()
```

The breathing system includes placeholder functionality for microphone integration, which can be extended to work with real breathing input in the future.

Available breathing patterns:
- **CALM** - Slow, deep breathing
- **FOCUSED** - Controlled, steady breathing
- **EXCITED** - Rapid, shallow breathing
- **MEDITATIVE** - Very slow, deep breathing with holds
- **CUSTOM** - User-defined pattern parameters

## Neuroplasticity System

The Neuroplasticity module provides mechanisms for neural networks to adapt their structure based on activity patterns and breathing state:

```python
from src.v9.neuroplasticity import Neuroplasticity, PlasticityMode
from src.v9.neural_playground import NeuralPlayground

# Create playground and neuroplasticity
playground = NeuralPlayground(size=100)
neuroplasticity = Neuroplasticity(
    plasticity_strength=0.2,  # How strongly connections are modified
    default_mode=PlasticityMode.BREATH_ENHANCED  # Use breathing to guide plasticity
)

# Run a play session
result = playground.play(duration=100, play_type="mixed", intensity=0.7)

# Apply neuroplasticity
stats = neuroplasticity.process_network(playground.core)

print(f"Connections strengthened: {stats['connections_strengthened']}")
print(f"Connections created: {stats['connections_created']}")
print(f"Connections pruned: {stats['connections_pruned']}")
```

### Integration with Breathing System

The Neuroplasticity system can be integrated with the Breathing System to create a bidirectional relationship where breathing patterns influence neural plasticity:

```python
from src.v9.neuroplasticity import integrate_with_playground
from src.v9.neural_playground_integration import NeuralPlaygroundIntegration
from src.v9.breathing_system import BreathingSystem, BreathingPattern

# Set up components
playground = NeuralPlayground(size=100)
integration = NeuralPlaygroundIntegration(playground)
breathing = BreathingSystem(default_pattern=BreathingPattern.MEDITATIVE)
neuroplasticity = Neuroplasticity(plasticity_strength=0.2)

# Start breathing simulation
breathing.start_simulation()

# Register components
integration.register_component("breathing_system", breathing, "neural")
integration.register_component("neuroplasticity", neuroplasticity, "neural")

# Set up integration hooks
breathing_hooks = breathing.integrate_with_playground(playground)
for hook_name, hook_func in breathing_hooks["hooks"].items():
    integration.integration_hooks[hook_name].append(hook_func)

neuroplasticity_hooks = integrate_with_playground(playground, neuroplasticity)
for hook_name, hook_func in neuroplasticity_hooks["hooks"].items():
    integration.integration_hooks[hook_name].append(hook_func)

# Run integrated play session
result = integration.run_integrated_play_session(
    duration=200,
    play_type="mixed",
    intensity=0.8
)

# Check neuroplasticity statistics
if "neuroplasticity_stats" in result:
    stats = result["neuroplasticity_stats"]
    print(f"Connections strengthened: {stats['connections_strengthened']}")
    print(f"Connections created: {stats['connections_created']}")
    print(f"Connections pruned: {stats['connections_pruned']}")
```

### Breath-Enhanced Plasticity

Different breathing patterns influence neuroplasticity in distinct ways:

- **CALM breathing**: Balanced plasticity with moderate connection strengthening and pruning
- **FOCUSED breathing**: Enhanced Hebbian learning with stronger connection formation
- **MEDITATIVE breathing**: Memory consolidation through pattern strengthening
- **EXCITED breathing**: Increased neural variability with more connection creation

### Plasticity Modes

The Neuroplasticity system supports multiple operational modes:

- **HEBBIAN**: Strengthen connections between co-active neurons
- **HOMEOSTATIC**: Balance activity across the network
- **STDP**: Spike-timing-dependent plasticity
- **BREATH_ENHANCED**: Plasticity guided by breathing state
- **CONSOLIDATION**: Strengthen important patterns
- **PRUNING**: Remove weak or unused connections
