Neural Plasticity Module - v9.0.0
---------------------------------
This module implements biologically-inspired plasticity mechanisms that enable
dynamic adaptation of neural connections based on activity patterns.

The module provides foundational learning capabilities for the Lumina Neural Network
System through Hebbian learning, homeostatic regulation, and structural plasticity.

Key features:
- Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
- Homeostatic synaptic scaling
- Metaplasticity mechanisms
- Structural plasticity (connection formation and pruning)
- Integration with breathing rhythm and attention systems
