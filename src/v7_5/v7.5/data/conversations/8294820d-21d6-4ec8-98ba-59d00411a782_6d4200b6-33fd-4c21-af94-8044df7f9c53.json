  "system_response": "I don't have memory retention in the same way that a human does. As a large language model, I don't maintain a memory of our conversation after I've generated a response. Each time you ask me a question, it's like starting a new conversation. I don't remember what we talked about before unless you bring it up again in the current conversation. This is because I process each query independently, without reference to previous interactions. I'm designed to provide the most accurate and helpful response to each question, regardless of whether it's part of an ongoing conversation or not.",
