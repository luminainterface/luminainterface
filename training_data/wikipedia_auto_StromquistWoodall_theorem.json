  "content": "The Stromquist–Woodall theorem is a theorem in fair division and measure theory. Informally, it says that, for any cake, for any n people with different tastes, and for any fraction w, there exists a subset of the cake that all people value at exactly a fraction w of the total cake value, and it can be cut using at most \n\n\n\n2\nn\n−\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2n-2}\n\n cuts.[1]\n\nThe theorem is about a circular 1-dimensional cake (a \"pie\"). Formally, it can be described as the interval [0,1] in which the two endpoints are identified. There are n continuous measures over the cake: \n\n\n\n\nV\n\n1\n\n\n,\n…\n,\n\nV\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle V_{1},\\ldots ,V_{n}}\n\n; each measure represents the valuations of a different person over subsets of the cake. The theorem says that, for every weight \n\n\n\nw\n∈\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w\\in [0,1]}\n\n, there is a subset \n\n\n\n\nC\n\nw\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C_{w}}\n\n, which all people value at exactly \n\n\n\nw\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w}\n\n:\n\nwhere \n\n\n\n\nC\n\nw\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C_{w}}\n\n is a union of at most \n\n\n\nn\n−\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n-1}\n\n intervals. This means that \n\n\n\n2\nn\n−\n2\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 2n-2}\n\n cuts are sufficient for cutting the subset \n\n\n\n\nC\n\nw\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C_{w}}\n\n. If the cake is not circular (that is, the endpoints are not identified), then \n\n\n\n\nC\n\nw\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle C_{w}}\n\n may be the union of up to \n\n\n\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n}\n\n intervals, in case one interval is adjacent to 0 and one other interval is adjacent to 1.\n\nLet \n\n\n\nW\n⊆\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W\\subseteq [0,1]}\n\n be the subset of all weights for which the theorem is true. Then:\n\nFrom 1-4, it follows that \n\n\n\nW\n=\n[\n0\n,\n1\n]\n\n\n{\\displaystyle W=[0,1]}\n\n. In other words, the theorem is valid for every possible weight.\n\nStromquist and Woodall prove that the number \n\n\n\nn\n−\n1\n\n\n{\\displaystyle n-1}\n\n is tight if the weight \n\n\n\nw\n\n\n{\\displaystyle w}\n\n is either irrational, or rational with a reduced fraction \n\n\n\nr\n\n/\n\ns\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r/s}\n\n such that \n\n\n\ns\n≥\nn\n\n\n{\\displaystyle s\\geq n}\n\n.\n",
