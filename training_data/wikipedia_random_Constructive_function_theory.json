  "content": "In mathematical analysis, constructive function theory is a field which studies the connection between the smoothness of a function and its degree of approximation.[1][2] It is closely related to approximation theory. The term was coined by Sergei Bernstein.\n\nLet f be a 2π-periodic function. Then f is α-Hölder for some 0 < α < 1 if and only if for every natural n there exists a trigonometric polynomial Pn of degree n such that\n\nwhere C(f) is a positive number depending on f. The \"only if\" is due to Dunham Jackson, see  Jackson's inequality; the \"if\" part is due to Sergei Bernstein, see Bernstein's theorem (approximation theory).\n",
