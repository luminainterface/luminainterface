  "content": "In mathematics, an isomorphism is a structure-preserving mapping or morphism between two structures of the same type that can be reversed by an inverse mapping. Two mathematical structures are isomorphic if an isomorphism exists between them. The word is derived from Ancient Greek  ἴσος (isos) 'equal' and  μορφή (morphe) 'form, shape'.\n\nThe interest in isomorphisms lies in the fact that two isomorphic objects have the same properties (excluding further information such as additional structure or names of objects). Thus isomorphic structures cannot be distinguished from the point of view of structure only, and may be identified. In mathematical jargon, one says that two objects are the same up to an isomorphism.[citation needed]\n\nAn automorphism is an isomorphism from a structure to itself. An isomorphism between two structures is a canonical isomorphism  (a canonical map that is an isomorphism) if there is only one isomorphism between the two structures (as is the case for solutions of a universal property), or if the isomorphism is much more natural (in some sense) than other isomorphisms. For example, for every prime number p, all fields with p elements are canonically isomorphic, with a unique isomorphism. The isomorphism theorems provide canonical isomorphisms that are not unique.\n\nThe term isomorphism is mainly used for algebraic structures. In this case, mappings are called homomorphisms, and a homomorphism is an isomorphism if and only if it is bijective.\n\nIn various areas of mathematics, isomorphisms have received specialized names, depending on the type of structure under consideration. For example:\n\nCategory theory, which can be viewed as a formalization of the concept of mapping between structures, provides a language that may be used to unify the approach to these different aspects of the basic idea.\n\nLet \n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{+}}\n\n be the multiplicative group of positive real numbers, and let \n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} }\n\n be the additive group of real numbers.\n\nThe logarithm function \n\n\n\nlog\n:\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n→\n\nR\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\log :\\mathbb {R} ^{+}\\to \\mathbb {R} }\n\n satisfies \n\n\n\nlog\n⁡\n(\nx\ny\n)\n=\nlog\n⁡\nx\n+\nlog\n⁡\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\log(xy)=\\log x+\\log y}\n\n for all \n\n\n\nx\n,\ny\n∈\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x,y\\in \\mathbb {R} ^{+},}\n\n so it is a group homomorphism. The exponential function \n\n\n\nexp\n:\n\nR\n\n→\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\exp :\\mathbb {R} \\to \\mathbb {R} ^{+}}\n\n satisfies \n\n\n\nexp\n⁡\n(\nx\n+\ny\n)\n=\n(\nexp\n⁡\nx\n)\n(\nexp\n⁡\ny\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\exp(x+y)=(\\exp x)(\\exp y)}\n\n for all \n\n\n\nx\n,\ny\n∈\n\nR\n\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x,y\\in \\mathbb {R} ,}\n\n so it too is a homomorphism.\n\nThe identities \n\n\n\nlog\n⁡\nexp\n⁡\nx\n=\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\log \\exp x=x}\n\n and \n\n\n\nexp\n⁡\nlog\n⁡\ny\n=\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\exp \\log y=y}\n\n show that \n\n\n\nlog\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\log }\n\n and \n\n\n\nexp\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\exp }\n\n are inverses of each other. Since \n\n\n\nlog\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\log }\n\n is a homomorphism that has an inverse that is also a homomorphism, \n\n\n\nlog\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\log }\n\n is an isomorphism of groups, i.e., \n\n\n\n\n\nR\n\n\n+\n\n\n≅\n\nR\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{+}\\cong \\mathbb {R} }\n\n via the isomorphism \n\n\n\nlog\n⁡\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\log x}\n\n.\n\nThe \n\n\n\nlog\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\log }\n\n function is an isomorphism which translates multiplication of positive real numbers into addition of real numbers. This facility makes it possible to multiply real numbers using a ruler and a table of logarithms, or using a slide rule with a logarithmic scale.\n\nConsider the group \n\n\n\n(\n\n\nZ\n\n\n6\n\n\n,\n+\n)\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (\\mathbb {Z} _{6},+),}\n\n the integers from 0 to 5 with addition modulo 6.

Some are more specifically studied; for example:\n\nJust as the automorphisms of an algebraic structure form a group, the isomorphisms between two algebras sharing a common structure form a heap. Letting a particular isomorphism identify the two structures turns this heap into a group.\n\nIn mathematical analysis, the Laplace transform is an isomorphism mapping hard differential equations into easier algebraic equations.\n\nIn graph theory, an isomorphism between two graphs G and H is a bijective map f from the vertices of G to the vertices of H that preserves the \"edge structure\" in the sense that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v in G if and only if there is an edge from \n\n\n\nf\n(\nu\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(u)}\n\n to \n\n\n\nf\n(\nv\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(v)}\n\n in H. See graph isomorphism.\n\nIn order theory, an isomorphism between two partially ordered sets P and Q is a bijective map \n\n\n\nf\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f}\n\n from P to Q that preserves the order structure in the sense that for any elements \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n and \n\n\n\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y}\n\n of P we have \n\n\n\nx\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x}\n\n less than \n\n\n\ny\n\n\n{\\displaystyle y}\n\n in P if and only if \n\n\n\nf\n(\nx\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(x)}\n\n is less than \n\n\n\nf\n(\ny\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f(y)}\n\n in Q. As an example, the set {1,2,3,6} of whole numbers ordered by the is-a-factor-of relation is isomorphic to the set {O, A, B, AB} of blood types ordered by the can-donate-to relation. See order isomorphism.\n\nIn mathematical analysis, an isomorphism between two Hilbert spaces is a bijection preserving addition, scalar multiplication, and inner product.\n\nIn early theories of logical atomism, the formal relationship between facts and true propositions was theorized by Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein to be isomorphic. An example of this line of thinking can be found in Russell's Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy.\n\nIn cybernetics, the good regulator theorem or Conant–Ashby theorem is stated as \"Every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system\". Whether regulated or self-regulating, an isomorphism is required between the regulator and processing parts of the system.\n\nIn category theory, given a category C, an isomorphism is a morphism \n\n\n\nf\n:\na\n→\nb\n\n\n{\\displaystyle f:a\\to b}\n\n that has an inverse morphism \n\n\n\ng\n:\nb\n→\na\n,\n\n\n{\\displaystyle g:b\\to a,}\n\n that is, \n\n\n\nf\ng\n=\n\n1\n\nb\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle fg=1_{b}}\n\n and \n\n\n\ng\nf\n=\n\n1\n\na\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle gf=1_{a}.}\n\n\n\nTwo categories C and D are isomorphic if there exist functors \n\n\n\nF\n:\nC\n→\nD\n\n\n{\\displaystyle F:C\\to D}\n\n and \n\n\n\nG\n:\nD\n→\nC\n\n\n{\\displaystyle G:D\\to C}\n\n which are mutually inverse to each other, that is, \n\n\n\nF\nG\n=\n\n1\n\nD\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle FG=1_{D}}\n\n (the identity functor on D) and \n\n\n\nG\nF\n=\n\n1\n\nC\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle GF=1_{C}}\n\n (the identity functor on C).\n\nIn a concrete category (roughly, a category whose objects are sets (perhaps with extra structure) and whose morphisms are structure-preserving functions), such as the category of topological spaces or categories of algebraic objects (like the category of groups, the category of rings, and the category of modules), an isomorphism must be bijective on the underlying sets. In algebraic categories (specifically, categories of varieties in the sense of universal algebra), an isomorphism is the same as a homomorphism which is bijective on underlying sets. However, there are concrete categories in which bijective morphisms are not necessarily isomorphisms (such as the category of topological spaces).\n\nSince a composition of isomorphisms is an isomorphism, since the identity is an isomorphism and since the inverse of an isomorphism is an isomorphism, the relation that two mathematical objects are isomorphic is an equivalence relation. An equivalence class given by isomorphisms is commonly called an isomorphism class.[2]\n\nExamples of isomorphism classes are plentiful in mathematics.\n\nHowever, there are circumstances in which the isomorphism class of an object conceals vital  information about it.\n\nAlthough there are cases where isomorphic objects can be considered equal, one must distinguish  equality and isomorphism.[3] Equality is when two objects are the same, and therefore everything that is true about one object is true about the other. On the other hand, isomorphisms are related to some structure, and two isomorphic objects share only the properties that are related to this structure.\n\nFor example, the sets\n\n\n\n\nA\n=\n\n{\n\nx\n∈\n\nZ\n\n∣\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n<\n2\n\n}\n\n\n\n and \n\n\nB\n=\n{\n−\n1\n,\n0\n,\n1\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle A=\\left\\{x\\in \\mathbb {Z} \\mid x^{2}<2\\right\\}\\quad {\\text{ and }}\\quad B=\\{-1,0,1\\}}\n\n\nare equal; they are merely different representations—the first an intensional one (in set builder notation), and the second extensional (by explicit enumeration)—of the same subset of the integers. By contrast, the sets \n\n\n\n{\nA\n,\nB\n,\nC\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{A,B,C\\}}\n\n and \n\n\n\n{\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n}\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\{1,2,3\\}}\n\n are not equal since they do not have the same elements. They are isomorphic as sets, but there are many choices (in fact 6) of an isomorphism between them: one isomorphism is\n\nwhile another is \n\nand no one isomorphism is intrinsically better than any other.[note 1] On this view and in this sense, these two sets are not equal because one cannot consider them identical: one can choose an isomorphism between them, but that is a weaker claim than identity and valid only in the context of the chosen isomorphism.\n\nAlso, integers and even numbers are isomorphic as ordered sets and abelian groups (for addition), but cannot be considered equal sets, since one is a proper subset of the other.\n\nOn the other hand, when sets (or other mathematical objects) are defined only by their properties, without considering the nature of their elements, one often considers them to be equal. This is generally the case with solutions of universal properties.\n\nFor example, the rational numbers are formally defined as equivalence classes of pairs of integers, although nobody thinks of a rational number as a set (equivalence class). The universal property of the rational numbers is essentially that they form a field that contains the integers and does not contain any proper subfield. Given two fields with these properties, there is a unique field isomorphism between them. This allows identifying these two fields, since every property of one of them can be transferred to the other through the isomorphism. The real numbers that can be expressed as a quotient of integers form the smallest subfield of the reals. There is thus a unique isomorphism from this subfield of the reals to the rational numbers defined by equivalence classes.\n",
