  "content": "LAPTV (Latin American Pay Television Service) was a Latin American pay television company founded by many cable providers of the region (MVS Comunicaciones, Grupo Cisneros) and many cinema producers/distributors (such as United International Pictures, distributor of Paramount Pictures and Universal Studios). It runs several film and television series channels, such as Cinecanal and Film Zone, and previously Moviecity.\n\nLAPTV was formed as a partnership between Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, and Fox in Latin America[2] in 1993[1] with Universal Studios joining later.[3] On May 22, 2012, Fox International Channels acquired MGM's stake in LAP TV.[4] In March 2013, Fox purchased Paramount's position in the company, thus becoming the sole owner of LAP TV, and sign a content agreement with LAP TV.[2]\nStarting on November 3, 2014, all the Premium channels of the pack were rebranded as \"Fox+\", dropping the \"Movie City\" brand definitely, and consolidating the Fox brand in LAPTV with the operations in Fox International Channels.[5] Operations of Cinecanal and Film Zone were unaffected.\n\nThis article about a television station in the U.S. state of Georgia is a stub.
