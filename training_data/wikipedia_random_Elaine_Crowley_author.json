Her father died from tuberculosis in 1942. She eventually left Ireland at the end of the Second World War and joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) — a branch of the British army staffed entirely by women. She spent most of her adult life in Wales.[4]\n\nShe is best known for her novels Dreams of Other Days, The Young Wives and a Family Cursed, all written during her latter years. She wrote a memoir of her childhood, A Dublin Girl: Growing Up in the 1930s (1996).[5]\n\nCrowley lived in Port Talbot with her husband; the couple had six children, eighteen grandchildren, and a large extended family. She died in Swansea on 8 February 2011, aged 83, from undisclosed causes.[6]\n",
