  "content": "25I-NB3OMe (2C-I-NB3OMe, NB3OMe-2C-I) is a phenethylamine hallucinogen which acts as a partial agonist for the human 5-HT2A receptor.[1]  It is a derivative of 2C-I.\n\nThis substance is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the N-benzylphenethylamine catch-all clause in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.[2]\n\n25I-NB3OMe is not explicitly listed as a controlled substance in the United States, but is a positional isomer of 25I-NBOMe[3] and thus may be considered a Schedule I drug under the Federal Analogue Act, meaning that it would be subject to the same penalties for possession, distribution, and manufacture as 25I-NBOMe.\n",
