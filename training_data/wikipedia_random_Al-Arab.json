  "content": "Al-Arab or Alarab (Arabic: العرب meaning The Arabs) is a pan-Arab newspaper published from London, England,[1] and sold in a number of countries.\n\nThe paper was launched in London on 1 June 1977,[2] as a secular pan-Arab daily.[3] Ahmed el-Houni, a former Libyan minister of information, was the owner and editor-in-chief of the daily.[4] Al-Arab sometimes reflected official Libyan government views and was run, as of 2004, by the Hounis as a family business, producing 10,000 copies that were also being printed in Tunisia and distributed throughout the Arab world, with the exception of some countries where it was banned.[5] It has undergone a series of expansions over the years, which included the launching of sister publications such as the magazine Al-Jadid and The Arab Weekly.[2]\n\nIts 10,000th issue, consisting of 24 pages, was published on 7 August 2015 and featured Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and the New Suez Canal on its front page.[2] The Al-Arab media organization also helped fund Ahval, a news website launched by Yavuz Baydar, a Turkish journalist who left Turkey following the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt. Qantara.de suspects Al-Arab and the government of the United Arab Emirates of influencing the creation of Ahval's Arabic language service.[3]\n\nThis London-related article is a stub.
