He also led protests against Nurul Amin visiting Jessore.[1] He was sued by the military government of Pakistan and imprisoned. He was released after Sheikh Mujibur Rahman asked General Yahya Khan to release him following the 1970 general elections in Pakistan.[1] He was elected to parliament from Jessore-5 in 1991, 1996, and in 2008 as a Bangladesh Awami League candidate.[3]\n\nSultan was married to Jesmin Ara Begum and had two sons - Humayun Sultan (Shadab) and Jubaer Sultan (Pelob).[1] In November 2014, Sultan and Jesmin went into hiding after a murder case was filed against them in connection with the death of their daughter-in-law, Shamarukh Mahjabin, in their house in Dhanmondi. According to her husband Humayun, Mahjabin committed suicide.[4]\n\nSultan died on 19 August 2017 in Central Hospital in Dhaka.[3] He was buried in Dhamalia.[5]\n\nThis article about an Awami League politician is a stub.
