This fort is an important fort in Ratnagiri district. The fort is a main tourist attraction due to the Bhagawati Temple inside the fort.\n\nThis fort was built during the Bahamani period. In 1670 Maratha emperor chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj won the fort from the hands of Adil Shah of Bijapur.[1] Shivaji maharaj had built protecting towers on two commanding points, one at the south and the other near the old court house. The Citadel defense was improved by maratha admiral Kanhoji Angre in 1750–1755. Dhondu Bhaskar Pratinidhi did some minor repairs to the fort during Peshwa regime (1755–1818).[2] The fort was later won by the British in 1818. The temple of Bhagavati was renovated in 1950.[3]\n\nThe nearest town is Ratnagiri. The fort is at walkable distance from the town. A wide road leads to the entrance gate of the fort.
