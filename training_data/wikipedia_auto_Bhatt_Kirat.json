  "content": "Bhatt Kirat was a Brahmin bard in the court of Guru Arjan, whose eight hymns are present in Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of Sikhs.[1][2][3][4] The title Bhatt is given to learned Brahmins.\n\nKirat was born, in Sultanpur Lodhi to Bhatt Bhika, in a Gaur Brahmin family (of Kaushish gotra) and he was brother of Bhatt Mathura.[5][6] His father's ancestors settled in Sultanpur from Ladwa village near Kurukshetra city (present day Haryana).[citation needed]\n\nBhai Kirat being tired of Mughal oppression, joined the sixth guru, Guru Hargobind to fight against the Mughal empire. He contributed and fought valiantly in Battle of Amritsar and killed Lahoreâ€™s Subedar Murtza Khan but because of heavy injury and blood loss, he attained martyrdom on the battlefield.[6]\n\nThis Sikhism-related article is a stub.
