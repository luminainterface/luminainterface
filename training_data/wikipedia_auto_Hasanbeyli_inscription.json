  "content": "The Hasanbeyli inscription is a Phoenician inscription on a basalt stone discovered in the village of Hasanbeyli, on the western slopes of the Amanus Mountains, in 1894.[1]\n\nIt was discovered by Felix von Luschan, who had been excavating at nearby Zincirli.\n\nThe Phoenician inscription is 5 lines long, and mentions the \"king of the city of Adana\", the \"king of Assur\" and \"Awariku\" (also on the Karatepe inscription). A short Greek inscription with two crosses has been overlaid; it is thought that it was used as a boundary marker during Byzantine times.\n\nIt has been dated to the 8th century BC. The stele measures 42 x 34 x 23 cm. It is currently in the Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin. The inscription is known as KAI 23.\n",
