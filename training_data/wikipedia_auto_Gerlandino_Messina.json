He was on the most wanted list of the Italian Ministry of the Interior from 1999 to 2010 when he was captured in Favara.[1]\n\nHe is the son of Giuseppe Messina, the Mafia boss of Porto Empedocle, who on 8 July 1986, was killed by the Grassonelli clan,[2] which adhered to the Stidda – a criminal organisation rivaling Cosa Nostra. In revenge, six members of the Grassonelli clan were killed on 21 September 1986, in the so-called Porto Empedocle massacre.\n\nHe is considered to be one of the bosses of Cosa Nostra in the province of Agrigento, jointly with Giuseppe Falsone.[3][4]\n\nOn 23 October 2010, he was captured by a special unit of the Carabinieri while he was in his house in Favara, near Agrigento.[5] He was wanted for Mafia association and several murders,[1] such as the killing of police officer Giuliano Guazzelli in April 1992.[6]\n\nIn 2012, he was sentenced to 9 years and 6 months of imprisonment for illegal possession of firearms.\n\nThis biographical article related to crime is a stub.
