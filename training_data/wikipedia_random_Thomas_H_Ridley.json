He represented Trinity Bay in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly from 1869 to 1871 as a Confederate.\n\nHe was born in Harbour Grace, the son of Thomas Ridley. Ridley entered his father's fishery supply business. He served as a member of the Legislative Council from 1855 to 1869. In 1871, Ridley resigned his seat in the assembly and moved to England. By this time, the family business was failing: it was declared insolvent in 1873. Ridley died in London.\n\nThis article about a Newfoundland and Labrador politician is a stub.
