  "content": "Nonstructural protein 3 (NS3), also known as p-70, is a viral nonstructural protein that is 70 kDa cleavage product of the hepatitis C virus polyprotein. It acts as a serine protease.[1][2] C-terminal two-thirds of the protein also acts as helicase and nucleoside triphosphatase.[3] First (N-terminal) 180 aminoacids of NS3 has additional role as cofactor domains for NS2 protein.[4]\n\nThis virus-related article is a stub.
