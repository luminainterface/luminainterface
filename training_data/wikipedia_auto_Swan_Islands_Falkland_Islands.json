  "content": "The Swan Islands (Spanish: Islas del Cisne) are a small group of islands in the middle of Falkland Sound in the Falkland Islands, and comprising Swan Island and the smaller West Swan Island and North Swan Island.\n\nThe islands are low-lying, and mainly covered in tussac grass, with the birdlife common to most of the Falkland Islands.\n\nThe islands lie between West Falkland and Lafonia on East Falkland, the two largest islands of the archipelago, and which shelter them from rougher weather from the east and west.\n\nAdmiral George Grey, surveying the Falkland Islands in 1836, says in his journal entry of 21 December -\n\nIt is perhaps from this swan that the islands derive their name.\n\nThis Falkland Islands location article is a stub.
