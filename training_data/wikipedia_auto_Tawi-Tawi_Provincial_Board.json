  "content": "The Tawi-Tawi Provincial Board is the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (provincial legislature) of the Philippine province of Tawi-Tawi.\n\nThe members are elected via plurality-at-large voting. The province is divided into two districts, each with four seats.  A voter votes for up to four names, with the top four candidates per district being elected. The vice governor is the ex officio presiding officer and only votes to break ties. The vice governor is elected via the plurality voting system province-wide.\n\nThe districts used in appropriating members are not coextensive with the legislative district of Tawi-Tawi; unlike congressional representation, which is at-large, Tawi-Tawi is divided into two districts for representation in the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.\n\nAside from the regular members, the board also includes the provincial federation presidents of the Liga ng mga Barangay (ABC, from its old name, \"Association of Barangay Captains\"), the Sangguniang Kabataan (SK, youth councils) and the Philippine Councilors League (PCL). Tawi-Tawi's provincial board also has reserved seats for the sectoral representatives for women, agricultural workers, and businessmen.\n\nThese are the members after the 2019 local elections[1] and 2018 barangay and SK elections:\n",
