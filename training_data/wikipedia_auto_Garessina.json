  "content": "The Garessina or Muma is a breed of small sheep from the Garessina, the area surrounding Garessio in the province of Cuneo, in Piemonte in north-west Italy.[3] It is raised principally in the valleys of the Tanaro, its affluent the Negrone, and the Casotto; it is not raised commercially, but kept as a family sheep.[4][5] It has been influenced by Spanish Merino and French Alpine breeds. The wool is of fine quality.[4] The Garessina is one of the forty-two autochthonous local sheep breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep-breeders.[5]\n\nUnder the national Piano Sviluppo Regionale or regional development plan for 2000â€“2006, a subsidy was available for those who kept Garessina sheep; in 2004 it was claimed for 64 head.[6] In 2013 the total number recorded for the breed was 110.[7]\n\nThis Italy-related article is a stub.
