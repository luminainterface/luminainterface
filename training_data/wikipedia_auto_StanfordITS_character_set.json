  "content": "Stanford/ITS character set is an extended ASCII character set based on SEASCII with modifications allowing compatibility with 1968 ASCII.[2]\n\nIt is used as an alternate character set of the SUPDUP protocol for terminals with %TOSAI and %TOFCI bits set.[2] It is also recommended for TeX implementations on systems with large character sets.[1] The default plain TeX macro package sets values B16 (↑) and 116 (↓) as alternative character codes for superscripts and subscripts, respectively (the default being ^ and _).[3]\n\nThe Knight keyboard is an example of a keyboard capable of inputting all of the defined characters excluding ⋅γδ±⊕◊∫, as they are mapped to ASCII commands NUL, HT, LF, FF, CR, ESC and DEL, respectively.\n\nEach character is encoded as a single seven-bit code value. It contains all 95 printable ASCII characters along with 27 mathematical symbols and 6 Greek letters.\n",
