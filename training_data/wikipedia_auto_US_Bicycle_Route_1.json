It is one of the two original U.S. Bicycle Routes, the other being U.S. Bicycle Route 76.\n\nAASHTO recognizes the segments in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine as being the only \"official\" segments of USBR 1. The other segments, even if signed or mapped, have not yet been submitted by the states to AASHTO for formal inclusion or recognition in the U.S. Bicycle Route system. The New Hampshire and Maine sections of USBR 1 were approved in May 2011,[2] with the New Hampshire section following the East Coast Greenway. Also approved was an alternate route, U.S. Bicycle Route 1A, that runs closer to the coast through a portion of Maine.[3][4][2]  Florida and Massachusetts segments were established in November 2014.[5]  Georgia's segment was designated in May 2019.[6]\n\nIn Georgia, State Bicycle Route 95 is planned to be incorporated into USBR 1.[7]\n\nThe following communities are serviced by the route:\n\nGeorgia\n\nU.S. Bicycle Route 1A is an alternate route to USBRÂ 1 in Maine, following the Atlantic coast between Brunswick and Bucksport.\n",
