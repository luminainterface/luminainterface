1. Introduction and Historical Context
1.1 Genesis of Multi-Base Quantum Symbolic Physics
Multi-Base Quantum Symbolic Physics emerges from the convergence of several
intellectual traditions and the recognition of fundamental limitations in existing
physical theories. While conventional physics has made remarkable progress
in understanding the physical world through the Standard Model and General
1
Relativity, significant challenges remain, including the reconciliation of quantum
mechanics and gravity, the role of the observer in physical systems, and the
relationship between information, meaning, and physical processes.
MBQSP addresses these challenges by reconsidering a fundamental assumption
that has remained largely unexamined in modern physics: the privileged status
of the decimal number system. By recognizing that different numerical bases
may be optimal for representing different aspects of reality, MBQSP opens new
mathematical possibilities that extend beyond conventional approaches.
1.2 Historical Precursors
MBQSP builds upon several historical developments in physics, mathematics,
and philosophy:
1.Quantum Mechanics : The observer effect, wave-particle duality, and
quantum entanglement established by Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and
others.
2.Information Theory : Shannon’s information theory and Wheeler’s “it
from bit” concept suggesting information as fundamental.
3.Symbolic Systems : Structuralist approaches to language and meaning
from Saussure to Lévi-Strauss.
4.Cultural Mathematics : Ethnomathematical studies revealing diverse
numerical systems across cultures.

problem to Penrose and Hameroff’s Orchestrated Objective Reduction.

2. Core Principles and Foundational Concepts
2.1 Fundamental Principles
MBQSP is founded on several core principles that distinguish it from conventional
physics:
1.Base Diversity Principle : Different numerical bases may be optimal for
representing different aspects of reality, with no single base having absolute
privileged status.
2.Domain Complementarity Principle : Reality consists of multiple
complementary domains (quantum, gravitational, symbolic, consciousness)
that cannot be fully reduced to one another.

a cultural and mathematical context that influences the observation itself.
4.Symbolic Realism Principle : Symbolic patterns and relationships have
ontological status comparable to physical entities and processes.

nomenon that interacts with other domains of reality.
6.Reality-Mythic Duality Principle : Reality has complementary objec-
tive and narrative aspects that cannot be fully separated.

between domains, with different types of information (physical, symbolic,
conscious) being interconvertible.
