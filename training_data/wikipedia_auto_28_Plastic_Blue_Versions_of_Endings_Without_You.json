  "content": "28 Plastic Blue Versions of Endings Without You is the second LP by the Boston band Francine. It was released on February 4, 2003, by Q Division Records. The album's subdued and personal tone is a departure from Francine's first album, Forty on a Fall Day.[2] Francine played scattered shows in the northeast USA after the album's release but did not tour. Considering, that this album has both fantastic songs and \"miscues\", it was received with mixed reviews.[3]\n\nThis 2000s indie rock albumâ€“related article is a stub.
