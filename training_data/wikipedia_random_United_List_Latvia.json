  "content": "The United List (Latvian: Apvienotais saraksts; AS) is a centrist[2] to centre-right,[3] regionalist[4] and green conservative[3] political alliance in Latvia established to contest the 2022 parliamentary election. The list consists of the Latvian Green Party, the Latvian Association of Regions, the Liepāja Party, as well as the \"United List of Latvia\" (Latvian: Apvienotais Latvijas saraksts) association led by Liepāja construction contractor Uldis Pīlēns.[5]\n\nThe list was founded on 1 July 2022.[6] Later, LRA and LZP leaders Edvards Smiltēns and Edgars Tavars became the co-chairmen of the board of the association, and Uldis Pīlēns was named as the prime minister candidate.[7][8]\n\nThe interim name of the ticket, in the works since May 2022, was reported as the \"United List of Latvia\" or the \"Latvia United List\" (Latvian: Latvijas apvienotais saraksts) – previously, \"Power of Regions\" (Reģionu spēks) was suggested.[9][10] The NGO led by Pīlēns scheduled its founding event for 1 July and announced that it would be called Apvienotais Latvijas saraksts.[11] Pīlēns was announced as the alliance's candidate for Prime Minister.\n\nOne of the catalysts in the origins of the alliance was the refusal of the Green and Liepāja parties to work with their former Union of Greens and Farmers partners as they promoted convicted oligarch Aivars Lembergs as their prime ministerial candidate.[12]\n\nThis article about a Latvian political party is a stub.
