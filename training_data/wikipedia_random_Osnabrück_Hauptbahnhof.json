The train services are operated by Deutsche Bahn, Hamburg-Köln-Express, NordWestBahn, Eurobahn and WestfalenBahn. The station features two levels, with lines at right angles to each other.\n\nClose to the railway stations are several stores including a cinema, a döner shop, an escort service, and a disco.\n\nOsnabrück Hauptbahnhof was ceremoniously opened as the “Central Station” by German Emperor Wilhelm II on 24 April 1895.[5] The new station was situated where the Hamburg-Venlo railway crossed the Hanoverian Western Railway at right angles with a height difference of 5.85 m (19.2 ft), which was why the design of a station at two levels was chosen.[6] The new station replaced the two separate previous stations, the Hanoverian station located on the Hanoverian Western Railway, and the Bremen station located on the Hamburg-Venlo railway line.\n\nThe following services currently call at Osnabrück Hauptbahnhof:[7]\n\nMany bus services depart from the bus station outside the station.\n\nA coach shuttle service to Münster Osnabrück Airport operates from the station, taking approximately 40 minutes to get from the railway station to the airport.[8]\n",
