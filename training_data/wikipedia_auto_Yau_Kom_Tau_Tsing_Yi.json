  "content": "Yau Kom Tau (Chinese: 油柑頭) is a geographical feature at the north shore of Tsing Yi Island in Hong Kong.[1][2] It originally was a flat headland formed by a small hill with a bay, Ngau Kok Wan (牛角灣), on its east and a valley and a swamp on its west. Its natural shoreline was reclaimed for the relocation of shipyards from Cheung Sha Wan. There are only two roads, Tam Kon Shan Road and Tsing Yi North Coastal Road on the headland.\n\n22°21′39″N 114°05′34″E﻿ / ﻿22.3609°N 114.0928°E﻿ / 22.3609; 114.0928\n\nThis Hong Kong location article is a stub.
