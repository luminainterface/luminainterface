  "content": "The Olympus Chrome Six is a series of folding cameras made by Takachiho and later Olympus from 1948 to 1956, for 6×4.5 or 6×6 exposures on 120 film.\n\nIn 1948, Olympus launched the Chrome Six I, an updated version of the Olympus Six of 1940[1] and its first postwar release of a folding camera for 120 film. The cameras were produced at the Suwa Plant in Nagano Prefecture. They were packaged and shipped on the same day to camera stores in Tokyo.[1]\n\nIn 1951 Olympus launched the Olympus Chrome Six IIIA, a successor to the Olympus Chrome Six I.[1] The camera had a film tensioner which held the film flat against the pressure plate,[2] the first implementation of this feature.[1] The Olympus Chrome Six RIIA was launched four years later in 1955. It had a high-precision rangefinder (not coupled with the lens), and was the most advanced camera of the series.[1]\n\nThis camera-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",
