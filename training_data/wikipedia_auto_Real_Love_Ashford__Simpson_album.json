  "content": "Real Love is an album by the American R&B duo Ashford & Simpson, released in 1986 via Capitol Records.[1][2]\n\nThe album peaked at No. 74 on the Billboard 200.[3] It was nominated for a Grammy Award, in the \"Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal\" category.[4] The duo promoted the album with an appearance on One Life to Live and a North American tour.[5]\n\nAll tracks from the album were written and produced by Ashford & Simpson.[6] Stevie Wonder contributed a harmonica solo to \"Nobody Walks in L.A.\"[7]\n\nThe Washington Post declared that Ashford & Simpson \"haven't lost their knack for knockout hooks, and they have a talent for telling tales to suit the top ten.\"[6] Robert Christgau wrote that \"not even 'Nobody Walks in L.A.', which makes good on its title but is too quirky and local for a single, takes it on home.\"[9] The Los Angeles Times thought that \"Count Your Blessings\" possesses \"the slick, black adult-contemporary sound that has become Ashford and Simpsonâ€™s stock in trade.\"[13] The Gazette called the album \"more seamless songs of love, loss and inspiration from the yuppies of soul.\"[14]\n\nAll tracks composed by Ashford and Simpson\n",
