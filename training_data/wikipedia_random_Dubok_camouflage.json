  "content": "\"Dubok\"[1] is a tricolor military camouflage designed for the Ukrainian Armed Forces in 1997. It was used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine until 2014.[2]\n\nThe camouflage is sometimes known unofficially as TTsKO  (Russian: Tryokhtsvetnaya kamuflirovannaya odezdha, lit.â€‰'Three Color Camouflage').[3]\n\nDubok was developed in 1997 for the Ukrainian Army.[4] It was designed as a replacement for Soviet-Era \"Butan\" camouflage uniform's in Ukrainian service, contrary to popular belief Dubok is not a variant of Russian, Ukrainian, or Soviet Butan, although it shares similarities with each, it is an entirely different pattern.\n\nDubok would eventually be replaced by MM-14 in 2014.[5] At the time, it was reported that Ukraine obtained Dubok fabric from Belarusian and Chinese producers.[6]\n\nThe color scheme \"oak\", known as \"amoeba\",[7] consists of a light green background, on which spots of green and brown colors are applied.[4] Camouflage is designed to blur the silhouette at long and close distances.\n\nBelarus formerly used a clone of the Ukrainian Dubok desert variant.[8]\n\nA desert variant was developed based on the Ukrainian version of the Dubok.[9][10] It is either known in the Ukrainian military as the Dubok-P (Desert) or Dubok-UA (Desert-UA).[1]\n",
