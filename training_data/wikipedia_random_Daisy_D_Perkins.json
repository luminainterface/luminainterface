  "content": "Daisy D. Perkins was Ohio’s first African American female lawyer.[1][2]\n\nPerkins’ father was John Perkins, a runaway slave who opened a barber shop after settling in North Baltimore, Ohio. She lost her mother at fourteen months of age.[3] Perkins went on to attend Findlay College with the financial support of her sisters.[4]\n\nShe relocated to Columbus, Ohio and became an autodidact in law. Her legal tutelage was provided by M.B. Earnhart, a Caucasian judge. In 1919, after having taken the bar examination seven times, she became the first African American female admitted to practice law in Ohio.[5] Later, she became a lawyer for the Office of the Columbus Prosecutor.[6]\n\nThis American law–related biographical article is a stub.
