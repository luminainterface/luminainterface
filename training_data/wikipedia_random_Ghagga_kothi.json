  "content": "Ghagga Kothi is a palatial mansion located in Ghagga town of Patiala District. It was built by  the Maharaja of Patiala  to accommodate himself and his guest who went there to hunt. It was taken over by Punjab Police after accession of Patiala State into India.\n\nGhagga Kothi is a tiny square fortress in about 8 acres (32,000Â m2) with a very beautiful rest housebuilt in the middle. The rest house was converted to a Station Head Office for Punjab Police with the Officer's residence on the upper floor.\n\nThere used to be another building near the Kothi outside the 'wall', on the south-west side known as Lassi Khaana. The building used to serve as the kitchen to the guests at the Kothi.\n\nDuring hunting expeditions the Viceroy of India and Prince of Wales once stayed here.\n\nDue to poor upkeep by the government, Lassi Khaana looked deserted ruins for long time, eventually met the dust.[clarification needed]\n",
