  "content": "The Grange Academy is a coeducational academy school in Runcorn, Cheshire. It is an all-through school providing primary and secondary education for pupils aged 3 to 16.[1]\n\nFormerly The Grange Comprehensive School, in June 2007 plans were announced for the school to close and to merge with The Heath School in 2012.[2] However, the Education & Skills Select Committee raised objections to the proposal[3] and it was decided that the school would join the adjacent Grange Nursery School, The Grange Infant School and The Grange Junior School to be an all-through school to be named The Grange School.[4]  Following improved examination results in 2008, the plan to merge with The Heath School was cancelled[5] and the school became all-through in September 2010.\n",
