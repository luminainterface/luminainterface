The highest number of events on the list have been promoted by New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), the largest professional wrestling promotion in Japan.\n\nNJPW's Collision in Korea, a two-day interpromotional supercard co-hosted with World Championship Wrestling, was the first-ever pro wrestling event held in North Korea and remains the most attended live event of all-time. The event reportedly had a combined crowd of 320,000, with 150,000 and 190,000 attending the first and second nights respectively.[1] Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter stated actual attendances were about 150,000 and 165,000.[2][3] Regardless, the second night of Collision in Korea remains the most attended overall live event of all-time. It is generally accepted that many attendees at Collision in Korea attended for free.[2]\n\nMany professional wrestling events are marketed with an inflated attendance figure \"for entertainment purposes\".[4] Some events below are excluded as their attendances have not been credibly verified â€“ for example, India and Pakistan allegedly hosted numerous wrestling shows pre-1970 which had attendances of over 40,000,[5][6] peaking in 1945 with the Emile Czaja vs. Hamida Pahalwan event at 200,000;[7] the existence of these events, however, have not been verified.\n\nNote: Minimum attendance of 40,000.\n\nGeneral\n\nSpecific\n",
