  "content": "In enzymology, a mevaldate reductase (NADPH) (EC 1.1.1.33) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction\n\nThus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-mevalonate and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are mevaldate, NADPH, and H+.\n\nThis enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-mevalonate:NADP+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include mevaldate (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), reductase, and mevaldate reductase (NADPH).\n\nThis EC 1.1.1 enzyme-related article is a stub.
