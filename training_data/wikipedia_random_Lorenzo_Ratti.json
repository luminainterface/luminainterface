  "content": "Lorenzo Ratti (c. 1589–1630) was an Italian baroque composer originating from Perugia. His parents were Girolamo and Isapaola Ugolini.[1] His uncle and teacher was Vincenzo Ugolini.[2] He was the predecessor of Carissimi at the Collegium Germanicum[3] and furthermore he was a teacher of Orazio Benevoli.[4][5]\n\nObviously born in Perugia in 1589 or 1590 the dates and places of his birth and death are not quite clear. Some sources like François-Joseph Fétis mention a village called Loreto in the surrounding of Naples as his place of birth, but Robert Eitner does not agree and claims Perugia to be Ratti's place of birth. Also an obviously originally in 1632 signed sheet of music makes his dying date seem to be doubtful.[6]\n\nFirst he was mentioned in 1598/99 as a boy soprano of the ''Cappella Giulia di S. Pietro'' in Rome and later on he is the third organist there. For a short time he was the first organist of the dome of Perugia (1613–1616). Returning to Rome he advanced to be the director of music of several ensembles.[1] His best known employments had been at S. Luigi dei Francesi as the teacher of Orazio Benevoli[7] and that of the director of music at the Collegium Germanicum at S. Loreto. At last he succeeded Antonio Cifra as the director of music at Santa Casa di Loreto.[1]\n\nHe composed lots of sacral works. Very well known are his six Gospel Dialogues for the oratory.[8][9] He is claimed to have composed 157 motets. Furthermore, he created a so-called dramma harmonico:[1]\n\nEitner also mentioned several works including their state of conservation and their location (partly translated and shortened):[6]\n",
