  "content": "Sycosis vulgaris  is a cutaneous condition characterized by a chronic infection of the chin or bearded region.[1]: 252 [2]\n\nThe irritation is caused by a deep infection of hair follicles, often by species of Staphylococcus or Propionibacterium bacteria.[3] It usually affects men who shave as this results in bacterial inoculation all over the face. Asymptomatic or painful and tender erythematous papules and pustules may form around coarse hair in the beard (sycosis barbae) or the back of the neck  (sycosis nuchae).[citation needed] In more severe cases, there may be crusting, follicular destruction and scarring.[4]\n\nThis infection-related cutaneous condition article is a stub.
