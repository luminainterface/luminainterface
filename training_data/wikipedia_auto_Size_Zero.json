The film was simultaneously shot in Telugu and Tamil language versions, the latter titled Inji Iduppazhagi. Produced by Prasad V. Potluri, the film features Anushka Shetty in the lead role while Arya, Prakash Raj, Urvashi and Sonal Chauhan play supporting roles.\n\nSize Zero was theatrically released worldwide on 27 November 2015 alongside its Tamil version, Inji Iduppazhagi.[citation needed]\n\nSoundarya aka Sweety is an overweight, brave, independent woman. She is slightly conscious about her weight but does not let it affect her. She falls in love with Abhishek, who was once a prospective groom for her and now a friend. She later finds out that he is in love with Simran. Sweety is devastated and joins a weight loss clinic called Size Zero as she thinks that her weight is the issue. One of her friends, Jyothi, who is in the clinic with her, develops kidney problems because of the weight loss drugs given in the clinic. Sweety begins a crusade against the clinic. She is joined by Abhi and Simran. Abhi slowly starts to fall for Sweety. The rest of the movie is how Sweety triumphs in her crusade and gets her Abhishek back.\n\nIn February 2015, Prasad V. Potluri announced a new bilingual film venture titled Size Zero, to be directed by Prakash Kovelamudi, which would star Arya and Anushka Shetty. Nirav Shah and M. M. Keeravani were signed on as cinematographer and music composer respectively, while the script was announced to be written by Prakash's wife Kanika.[4] Shruti Haasan was reported to be making an extended guest appearance, while Urvashi and Master Bharath also formed the principal cast.[5] The Tamil version of the film began shoot in March 2015, after a launch ceremony in Chennai.[6][7] Shruti Haasan soon left the project citing differences with the producers, after a conflict during the making of another film with them. Though it was suggested that she would instead perform an item number in the film instead, she also refuted the claims.[citation needed]\n\nAfter talks with other actress to replace her including Esha Gupta,[8] Sonal Chauhan subsequently joined the team to play the second female lead role in April 2015.[9] Nagarjuna enacted a guest appearance in the film during the shoot in May 2015, while Jiiva was signed to make a special appearance as well.[10] Dubbing voice for Arya in Telugu was provided by actor Nandu.[11]\n\nAnushka prepared for her role in the film by putting on weight to portray her character.[12]\n\nAfter shooting several schedules, in early July 2015 some important crucial romantic scenes were being shot between Arya and Shetty at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad.[citation needed] On 18 July 2015 makers released a press statement stating that the film's shoot was completed.[citation needed]\n\nMusic is composed by M. M. Keeravani. On 31 August 2015, a teaser was released in which the audio release date was stated as 6 September 2015.[citation needed] But, for unknown reasons makers postponed the audio launch.[13]\n\nSize Zero was initially scheduled for a global release on 2 October 2015, coinciding with Gandhi Jayanti.[citation needed] However, it was postponed to 21 October and finally released on 27 November 2015, alongside the Tamil version titled Inji Iduppazhagi.[14] Prior to the release, Sonal Chauhan, who plays an NRI in the movie, described the movie as a \"story with a lot of heart and made by a team of people who sincerely felt for it.\"[15]\n\nPranita Jonnalagedda of The Times of India rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote, \"Size Zero is slow at times and can go into a sermon mode but then it packs some moments which will make you laugh out loud.\"[16] Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle called the film, \"A good concept gone horribly wrong.\"[17]\n\nBaradwaj Rangan of The Hindu called it \"Lots of minuses in this story of a plus-sized woman\" in his review and criticized the film's dubbing.[18]\n",
