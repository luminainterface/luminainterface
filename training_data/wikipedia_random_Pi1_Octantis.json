  "content": "Pi1 Octantis (Pi1 Oct), Latinized π1 Octantis, is a solitary[11] star in the southern circumpolar constellation Octans. It is faintly visible to the naked eye with an apparent magnitude 5.64, and is estimated to be 387 light years away. However, it is receding with a heliocentric radial velocity of 14 km/s.[5]\n\nPi1 Oct has a stellar classification of G8/K0 III[3] — intermediate between a G8 and K0 giant star. It has 2.74 times the mass of the Sun and an effective temperature of 5,002 k,[7] giving a yellow hue. However, an enlarged radius of 11.62 R☉ yields a luminosity 76 times that of the Sun.[7] Pi1 Oct has a metallicity[7] around solar level and spins with a projected rotational velocity lower than 1 km/s.[8]\n",
