It was created from the southern section of Quincy Township and included the land area extending south to the Indiana state line.  While the early residents wanted the name of the new township to be named Carlton, it was unexplainably named Alagansee when the township was formally established.  The origin of both names is unknown, as the earliest township records have been lost.[7]\n\nAlgansee Township assumed its current boundaries on March 25, 1846 when California Township was set off from the southern section of the township.[8][9]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 36.09 square miles (93.47 km2), of which 35.53 square miles (92.02 km2) is land and 0.56 square miles (1.45 km2) (1.55%) is water.[10]\n\nAs of the census[3] of 2000, there were 2,061 people, 746 households, and 561 families residing in the township.
