In 2006, he was appointed to the Bertelsmann executive board, of which he has been chairman and chief executive officer since 2012.[3][4] Under his leadership, the group has become more international, more digital and more diversified.[5][6] In particular, he has advanced the business with music rights and the educational division.[7] Additionally, Rabe was appointed chief executive officer of RTL Group in 2019.[8]\n\nRabe was born in 1965 in Luxembourg and grew up in Brussels,[9][10] where his father worked as a civil servant in the European Coal and Steel Community from 1968.[11] He attended the European School and as a youth was a bass player in a punk band.[12] After completing his German baccalaureate (Abitur), Rabe studied Business and Economics at the RWTH Aachen and the University of Cologne.[13] After earning a degree in business administration in 1989, he obtained his doctorate in economics, with a doctoral thesis on \"Liberalization and Deregulation in the European Single Market for Insurance\" in 1995.[14]\n\nIn addition to his native language German, Rabe speaks English, French, Dutch and Spanish.[15]\n\nRabe began his career at the European Commission in Brussels. At the commission, from 1989 he worked in the Directorate-General for Financial Institutions and Corporate Law.[11] One year later, he joined his supervisor in moving to the law firm Forrester, Norall & Sutton,[16] which today belongs to White & Case.[17] There he managed client accounts from the European Union, the United States and Japan.[16] In 1991, Rabe was employed by the Treuhand agency in Berlin.[18] In this capacity, among other responsibilities, he was in charge of the privatization of the assets of the Ministry for State Security and the National People's Army of the former GDR.[19] In 1993, he was promoted to head of the Controlling Department.[13] Subsequently, Rabe was involved as head of acquisitions at the Beteiligungsgesellschaft Neue Länder investment agency of the Association of German Banks (BdB),[14] in investing DM 400 million in East German companies.[19] After earning his Ph.D., in 1996 Rabe was hired as office head of the CEO of the Luxembourg financial service provider, Cedel International.[16][19] He held additional positions there before being appointed chief financial officer in 1998.[20] In subsequent years, he prepared the merger of Cedel International with Deutsche Börse Clearing into Clearstream.[19]\n\nIn 2000, Rabe joined RTL Group as CFO.[14] Here, he was additionally responsible for strategy and the Luxembourg television and radio business.[21] Five years later, Bertelsmann brought him back to Gütersloh.[22][23][24] Rabe was appointed as the group's CFO on January 1, 2006.[25] At the same time, he was responsible for the Bertelsmann Music Group until 2008.[14] Among other activities, Rabe also negotiated the buyback of shares from Groupe Bruxelles Lambert to prevent Bertelsmann from going public.[12][26] In addition, the group established its own investment fund in Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments.[27] Later, Rabe organized the return of Bertelsmann into the music business.[28] His recruitment of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. as an investor in BMG Rights Management was seen as a key decision for the music company's future development.[2]\n\nAround 2009 Rabe was reportedly considered as future CEO of the ProSiebenSat.1 Media group and of the Franz Haniel & Cie. investment holding,[29] but Rabe ultimately stayed with Bertelsmann.[30][31]\n\nAfter Hartmut Ostrowski announced his retirement as chairman and CEO in 2011,[32] Rabe was declared his successor, effective January 1, 2012.[33][34] With Rabe's appointment, Bertelsmann ushered in a strategy change towards stronger growth.[35][36][37] Under his leadership, Bertelsmann experienced increased growth into Brazil, China, and India, and consolidated this development by bundling these activities in the Bertelsmann Investments division.[38][39] Also, Rabe managed to complete the merger of Penguin Books with Random House to create the world's largest trade book publisher, and the purchase of the remaining shares in Gruner + Jahr.[40][41] He built the education division into an additional pillar of the business,[42][43] which today operates as the Bertelsmann Education Group.[44] He consolidated the printing operations into the Bertelsmann Printing Group.[45] Thus, by 2016, he had expanded the number of corporate divisions to eight.[46][47]\n\nRabe's contract as chairman and CEO of Bertelsmann's executive board runs until 2021.[48][49] As CEO of RTL Group, he oversees the company's TV unit;[50] he is a member of the board of directors of Penguin Random House, among others.[51]\n\nRabe lives in Gütersloh and Berlin and is married to a neurologist.[56][57] The couple collects modern art and, in 2015, purchased a Henry van de Velde-designed villa in Tervuren near Brussels.[58]\n\nRabe is a member of the Catholic fraternity AV Hansea-Berlin zu Köln.[59]\n",
