  "content": "Avinash Singh Rathore, better known by his codename Tiger, is a fictional Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) agent appearing in the Tiger film series and other films of the YRF Spy Universe, an Indian cinematic universe.[1][2][3] He is portrayed by Salman Khan. The character first appeared in Ek Tha Tiger (2012) and appeared in its sequels Tiger Zinda Hai (2017) and Tiger 3 (2023). Tiger also made a brief appearance in Pathaan (2023), another film in the universe.[4][5][6]\n\nTiger was born on 29 December 1968 in Chambal, Madhya Pradesh, India.\n\nIn Ek Tha Tiger, Tiger disassociates himself with R&AW after eloping with Zoya Nazar, a Pakistani ISI agent. However, he remains loyal to India and occasionally goes on missions to save his country from threats.[7][8] Tiger is married to Zoya and has two sons: an adopted-son Hassan, a suicide bomber whom he adopted during a mission in Iraq and his biological son, Junior. He is one of the three main agents in the universe, along with Pathaan (portrayed by Shah Rukh Khan) and Kabir (portrayed by Hrithik Roshan).[9][10]\n\nThe family of Ravindra Kaushik, an Indian R&AW agent nicknamed \"Black Tiger\", claimed that the story of the film Ek Tha Tiger was based on his life and asked for credits in the film titles. In July 2012, a legal notice was served by the nephew of Kaushik, stating the film bears a striking resemblance to his uncle and his uncle's life.[11] Though director Kabir Khan denied these claims.[12]\n",
