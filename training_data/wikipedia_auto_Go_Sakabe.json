Around his junior high school, he used to compose songs at home, using the music notation software Finale. In high school, he joined the choir club and became more familiar with music. In the winter of his second year of high school, he decided to go to a music college, and later entered the Department of Composition at Kunitachi College of Music. After that, Sakabe studied under Toshihiko Sahashi—a composer and arranger—, while working as his assistant.[5]\n\nSakabe's musician career started in 2005, with him involved in writing songs for other artists.[6]\n\nIn 2007, he made his debut as a series composer with the opening theme song \"I Say Yes\" from the season 2 of the anime The Familiar of Zero.[7][8]\n",
