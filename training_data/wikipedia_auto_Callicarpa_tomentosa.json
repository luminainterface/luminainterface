Leaves simple, opposite; elliptic to broadly elliptic; apex acute or acuminate. Purplish flowers show branched axillary cymes. Fruit is 3-4 seeded globose drupe.[2] Fruits provide food for wildlife. They are sometimes used to make herbal medicine. The leaves are also food for wildlife.[3]\n\nThe leaf is known being used as a wick to light an oil lamp.[4]\n\nIn Hinduism, it is said in the legends that when the pandavas went to exile, they lit the tree by applying oil to the leaves and burning them.[5][better source needed]\n\nThis Lamiaceae article is a stub.
