  "content": "Kosmos 347 (Russian: Космос 347 meaning Cosmos 347), known before launch as DS-P1-Yu No.35, was a Soviet satellite which was launched in 1970 as part of the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik programme. It was a 250-kilogram (550 lb) spacecraft, which was built by the Yuzhnoye Design Bureau, and was used as a radar calibration target for anti-ballistic missile tests.[1]\n\nKosmos 347 was launched from Site 86/4 at Kapustin Yar,[2] atop a Kosmos-2I 63SM carrier rocket. The launch occurred on 12 June 1970 at 09:30:02 UTC, and resulted in the successful deployment of Kosmos 347 into low Earth orbit.[3] Upon reaching orbit, it was assigned its Kosmos designation, and received the International Designator 1970-043A.[4]\n\nKosmos 347 was the thirty-third of seventy nine DS-P1-Yu satellites to be launched,[1] and the thirtieth of seventy two to successfully reach orbit.[5] It was operated in an orbit with a perigee of 214 kilometres (133 mi), an apogee of 1,970 kilometres (1,220 mi), 48.4 degrees of inclination, and an orbital period of 107.1 minutes.[1][6] It remained in orbit until it decayed and reentered the atmosphere on 7 November 1971.[6]\n\nThis article about one or more spacecraft of the Soviet Union is a stub.
