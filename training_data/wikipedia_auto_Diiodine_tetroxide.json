  "content": "Diiodine tetraoxide, I2O4, is a chemical compound of oxygen and iodine. It belongs to the class of iodine oxides, and is a mixed oxide, consisting of iodine(III) and iodine(V) oxidation states.\n\nThe oxide is formed by the reaction of hot concentrated sulfuric acid on iodic acid for several days.[2]\n\nIt is formed from diiodine pentoxide and iodine in concentrated sulfuric acid or iodosyl sulfate (IO)2SO4 added to water:[3]\n\nAlternatively, excess of concentrated nitric acid oxidizes dry iodine to this salt.[4]\n\nDiiodine tetraoxide is a yellow, granular powder. At temperatures above 85 °C it decomposes to diiodine pentoxide and iodine:[2]\n\nThis process is even faster at 135 °C. It dissolves in hot water to form iodate and iodide.[2] Structurally, the compound is an iodyl iodite O2I-OIO (iodine(V,III) oxide)[2] with bent IVO2 units (I–O distances 1.80 and 1.85 Å; ∠OIO angle 97°) and bent IIIIO2 units (IO distances 1.93 Å, OIO angle 95.8°). Both units are linked via I—O—I bridges to form polymeric zigzag chains (I2O4)x.[2]\n\nDiiodine tetraoxide has a monoclinic crystal structure with the space group P21/c (space group number 14). Unit cell dimensions are a = 8.483 b = 6.696 c = 8.333 Å and β = 124.69°. Unit cell volume = 389.15 Å3. Z = 4. Density is 2.57 Mg/m3[3][5]\n\nDiiodine tetroxide oxidises hydrochloric acid:[6]\n\nIt decomposes[vague] in water.[4][7]\n",
