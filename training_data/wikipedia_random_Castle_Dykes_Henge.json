  "content": "Castle Dykes Henge is a Class I Neolithic henge earthwork in the Yorkshire Dales National Park in North Yorkshire, England, situated between the villages of Aysgarth and Thornton Rust. It consists of a roughly circular bank approximately 87 yards (80Â m) in diameter with an internal ditch.[1][2]\n\nIt is reported that excavation work took place in 1908, though there is little physical evidence of this as the henge appears to be mostly intact.[3] In 2015 the Royal Archaeological Institute awarded a research grant for a survey of the site and palaeoenvironmental sampling.[4]\n\nThis article relating to archaeology in the United Kingdom is a stub.
