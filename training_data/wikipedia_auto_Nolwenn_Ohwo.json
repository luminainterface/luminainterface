  "content": "\"Nolwenn Ohwo!\" is a 2006 song recorded by French singer Nolwenn Leroy. It was the first single from her second studio album Histoires Naturelles, and was released on 23 January 2006. It achieved success in France, where it topped the singles chart, and Belgium (Wallonia), where it was a top three hit.\n\nThe song was co-written by famous singer-songwriters Alain Souchon and Laurent Voulzy (he also participated in the writing of Leroy's previous album, notably on the song \"Suivre une Ã©toile\"), and Leroy herself. It was performed during the Histoires naturelles tour and was available in its live version on the album of the same name.\n\nIn France, the song was first released digitally in early December 2005. It was then officially released as a CD single in a limited edition on 23 January but it was sold by certain stores a few days before. Therefore, it entered the French single chart two days before, at #47, before climbing straight to #1 the week after. It then almost kept on dropping, and totalled four weeks in the top ten, 11 weeks in the top 50 and 19 weeks on the chart (top 100).[1]\n",
