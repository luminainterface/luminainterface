  "content": "Tempranillo is an album by British jazz saxophonist Evan Parker and Spanish pianist Agustí Fernández, which was recorded in 1995 and released on the Spanish Nova Era label. They had never played together before.[1]\n\nIn his review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek says that the record \"is one of those magical dates where everything that happens does so for a reason, and the result clarifies the process without much effort.\"[2]\n\nThe Penguin Guide to Jazz says about the pianist that \"At moments, he sounds as if be might be playing scores pieces by Xenakis or Stockhausen; at others, some passionate folk theme seems about to announce itself. Parker goes about his music with the same intensity as ever, listening, responding, interpolating new ideas.\"[3]\n",
