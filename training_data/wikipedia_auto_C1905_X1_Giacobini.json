  "content": "Giacobini's Comet, also known as C/1905 X1, is a bright parabolic comet that became visible to the naked eye in January 1906. It is one of 12 comets discovered by French astronomer, Michel Giacobini.\n\nWhile observing at the Nice Observatory in France, Michel Giacobini discovered the comet as an 8th-magnitude object within the constellation Bo√∂tes.[a] Throughout December 1905, the comet continued to brighten as it slowly approached both the Earth and the Sun, allowing follow-up observations to be conducted.\n\nThis comet-related article is a stub.
