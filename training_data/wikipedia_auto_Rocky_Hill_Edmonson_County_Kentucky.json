  "content": "\nRocky Hill is an unincorporated community in Edmonson County, Kentucky, United States,[1] located south of Mammoth Cave National Park. It is part of the Bowling Green, Kentucky Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\nPrior to the 1930s, Rocky Hill used to be a coal dropoff for the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. During the 1920s, the town had a population in the thousands and was booming with business. It had two livery stables, a general store, a railroad station, and two hotels. Devastation hit the town when it burned, burning down half of the city because of the inability of the volunteer fire department. Since then the VFD has strengthened greatly. After the fire, most people moved away from the city and the railroad stopped dropping off coal.\n\nSince then the town has tried to keep their heritage alive every year by hosting Rocky Hill Days at the VFD. A Civil War re-enactment has recently been added to the festival, with the hopes of having the re-enactment become an annual event.\n\nRocky Hill is located in southeastern Edmonson County along Kentucky Route 259 just north of the Warren County line, and just northwest of the tripoint where Edmonson and Warren County's boundaries intersect the Barren County line.[2]\n\nThe community's post office was established in 1859 as Rocky Hill Station. It was renamed Rocky Hill in 1923. Forty years later, when ZIP codes were introduced in 1963, it was assigned ZIP code 42163.\n\n37°04′08″N 86°08′11″W﻿ / ﻿37.0689357°N 86.1363697°W﻿ / 37.0689357; -86.1363697\n",
