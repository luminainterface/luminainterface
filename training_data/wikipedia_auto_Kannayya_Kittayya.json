  "content": "Kannayya Kittayya is a 1993 Indian Telugu-language fantasy comedy film written and directed by Relangi Narasimha Rao.[2] It stars Rajendra Prasad, Shobana, Aamani  and music composed by famous Telugu film director Relangi Narasimha Rao. The film was recorded as Above Average at the box office.[3]\n\nThe film begins in a village where Kittayya, an advent devotee of Krishna, calls him Kannayya out of adoration. He constantly bars the barbarities of his malicious maternal uncle, Bangaraiah, as they have a family feud. Kittayya's mother, Janakamma, is sworn to knit Bangaraiah's daughter Saroja with him to hit her brother's conceit. Saroja, a vainglory, returns from abroad when Kittayya mocks her. As a vengeance, Bangaraiah publicly mortifies them with a slick trick. Janakamma attempts suicide out of shame when Kittayya oaths her to make Bangaraiah bow down. Annoyed, Kittayya accuses & rebukes the Lord, and the words reach Krishna / Kannayya in Vaikuntha. Ergo, Kannayya, identical to Kittayya, is alarmed and sets foot on the Earth. Kishtaiah becomes overwhelmed by seeing him, but he is of others' sight. From there, Kannayya guides Kittayya, and he makes separate steps to win Saroja's heart. Ultimately, Kittayya triumphs when he secures her against danger. Discerning it, Bangaraiah wiles various pawns, such as seeking to slay Kittayya, incriminating him in a so-called robbery, etc. At all stages, Kannayya shields him when Kittayya takes a vow from the Lord to stay in his attire until his wedlock to counterstrike Bangaraiah.\n\nMeanwhile, Narada misinterprets the status quo and notifies the fairy story to Rukmini & Satyabhama that the Lord is wooing beauty on Earth. Hence, they land, dropping their divinity. After a few comic scenes, the Goddesses prejudge Kittayya for their husband by claiming themselves as his wives. Exploiting it, Bangaraiah raises a ruckus. Being incognizant of fact, Kittayya is furious and warns to slaughter the deities. Forthwith, Bangaraiah wiles to assassinate the women on Kittayya's account. Here, Kannayya gamely leads Kittayya to challenge his uncle, saying that if he could present them before villagers, Bangarayya should couple up Saroja with him. However, the boot is on the other foot because Rukmini & Satyabhama carry off Kannayya and seize him. Accordingly, Kittayya becomes a target of terrible torture on Earth. At last, Kittayya retrieves Kannayya with his idolization, proves non-guilty, and reforms Bangaraiah. Finally, the movie ends happily with Kittayya marrying Saroja and everyone declaring the existence of both Kannayya & Kittayya.\n\nMusic composed by Vamsy. Music released on Supreme Music Company.[4]\n",
