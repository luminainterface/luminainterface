  "content": "Acanthophoenix crinita is a species of palm which is endemic to Réunion.\n\nThis palm was first described as Areca crinita by French naturalist Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent in 1804 and classified by German botanist Hermann Wendland in its own genus Acanthophoenix in 1867.[1]\n\nIn his 1995 checklist of seed plants, Rafaël Govaerts considered A. crinita to be a synonym of Acanthophoenix rubra, as did Govaerts and John Dransfield in their 2005 checklist of palms.  However, in his revision of the genus, N. Ludwig recognised A. crinita as a separate species.[1]\n\nThis Réunion-related article is a stub.
