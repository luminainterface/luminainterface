  "content": "Woh Humsafar Tha (Urdu: وہ ہم سفر تھا, ‘Wuh ham-safar tha’ lit. He was my co-journeyer) is a song based on the ghazal written in 1971 by Naseer Turabi[1] after the Fall of Dhaka. It serves as the title song for the Pakistani drama serial Humsafar. It was originally sung by Abida Parveen[2] and later by Qurat-ul-Ain Balouch. The latter version included additional verses taken from Khalid Ahmad's ghazal Tark-e-Tallukat.[3]\n\nThe song is inspired by a ghazal written in 1971, following the Fall of Dhaka, by the renowned poet Naseer Turabi. He was profoundly affected by the painful division of Pakistan and composed the ghazal with deep emotion and intensity.[4] The lyrics of the ghazal eloquently express the poet's sorrow and heartache over the separation of the people, reflecting his personal anguish and the collective grief of the nation.[5]\n\nThe opening verse of the song, however, is derived from Khalid Ahmad's famous ghazal, Tark-e-Talluqat, which is a widely recognized and a celebrated piece of poetry in its own right.[3]\n\nIt was sung by Qurat-ul-Ain Balouch and used as the title song for the Urdu drama Humsafar. The lines of the song are frequently used during the course of the show. It was composed by Waqar Ali and produced by Momina Duraid. \n\nUpon the release of the Humsafar drama, Qurat-ul-Ain's version topped charts in Pakistan along with some other nations and captured a positive reviews from both critics.[6]\n",
