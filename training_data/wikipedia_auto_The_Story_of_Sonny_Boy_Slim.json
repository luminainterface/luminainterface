The album features 13 originals tracks and showcases many of Clark's signature moves.[clarification needed] Clark blends his usual styles of blues, rock and soul music, with occasional touches of hip hop and R&B, to create his signature sound.\n\nThe album's title was created by blending his two childhood nicknames. Sonny Boy was the nickname his mother gave him, Slim was given to him on the Austin Texas blues scene and referred to his tall and thin physical build.\n\nIt reached number one on the Billboard Top Blues Albums chart in October that year.[1]\n\nAll tracks are written by Gary Clark Jr., except where noted.\n\nAdapted from the album's liner notes.\n",
