  "content": "Alan Mandell (born Albert Mandell on December 27, 1927) is a Canadian-American actor known for playing Rabbi Marshak in the Coen Brothers' 2009 film A Serious Man. With several decades of experience as a stage actor, he is especially acclaimed as an interpreter of the works of Samuel Beckett.[1]\n\nAlbert Mandell was born to a Jewish family in Toronto, Ontario in 1927.[2] He acted on stage in both Canada and the United States, building a reputation in San Francisco's theater scene in the 1950s.[3] In 1968 he legally changed his given name to Alan to avoid being confused with noted mobster Albert Anastasia.[2]\n\nMandell's association with Beckett began in 1957, with a production of Waiting for Godot at the San Francisco Actor's Workshop. He subsequently played Lucky in a production of Godot directed by Beckett himself.[4]\n\nOutside of Beckett, Mandell has acted in productions of Harold Pinter's No Man's Land and Arthur Miller's The Price.[3] In 2007 he appeared as Juror #9 in a Los Angeles production of Twelve Angry Men, directed by Scott Ellis and costarring Richard Thomas and George Wendt.[5]\n\nThis article about an American theatre actor born in the 1920s is a stub.
