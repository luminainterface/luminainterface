  "content": "Soto Makikomi (外巻込) is one of the traditional forty throws of Judo as developed by Jigoro Kano. It belongs to the fourth group, Yonkyo, of the traditional throwing list, Gokyo (no waza),[1] of Kodokan Judo. It is also part of the current 67 Throws of Kodokan Judo.[2] Because tori takes a side fall next to uke, the technique is categorized as a side sacrifice technique, Yoku-sutemi.[3] Danzan Ryu's Makikomi (巻込) is also one of the twenty throws in the Nagete list, which most closely resembles Soto Makikomi.\n\nGraphic\nfrom http://www.judoinfo.com/techdraw.htm\n\nJudo:[1]\n\nDanzan Ryu:[2]\n\nExemplar Videos:\n\nDemonstrated,\nfrom http://www.suginoharyu.com/html/index.html\n\nTournament\nfrom http://www.judo.waw.pl/filmiki.html\n\nEnglish Aliases:\n\nThis article related to judo is a stub.
