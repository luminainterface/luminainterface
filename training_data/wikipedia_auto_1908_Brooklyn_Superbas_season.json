The club set a Major League record which still stands, for the fewest doubles by a team in a season, with only 110.[1] The Superbas hit only .213 as a team, second lowest in the modern era after the 1910 Chicago White Sox.  No regulars hit .250, Tim Jordan led the team with a .247 batting average.\n\nInfielders\n\nNote: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\n\nNote: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in\n\nNote: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\n\nNote: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\n\nNote: G = Games pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; SV = Saves; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts\n\nThis article relating to a Los Angeles Dodgers baseball season is a stub.
