The 168 m (551 ft), 41 floor,  587,473 sq ft (54,578.0 m2) office tower was completed in 1984.[4]\n\nThe One Sansome Street tower is built adjacent to the site of the ornate Anglo and London Paris National Bank, which was completed in 1910.[5]  Designed by architect Albert Pissis, the bank building was granite clad with 38 ft (12 m) high Doric columns.  The historic architecture of the bank building serves as a conservatory for the skyscraper today.[5]\n\nOne Sansome Street was acquired by Beacon Capital Partners LLC from BayernLB in 2005 for $217 million or $394.55 per ft² ($4,247.32 per m²).[6]  BayernLB bought the building in 1999 from subsidiaries of Citigroup and Dai-ichi Life for between $170–175 million, or $310–320 per ft² ($3,337-3,445 per m²).[7] By 2010, it was owned by Broadway Partners Fund Manager, LLC.[8] In 2010, a partnership between Barker Pacific Group and Prudential Real Estate Investors took ownership of the building.[9] In 2011, Citigroup signed a lease extension through 2022 to remain the building's anchor tenant.[9]\n\nThe building contains direct underground access to the Montgomery Street Station.\n",
