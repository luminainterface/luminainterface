It was built with red bricks in 1875 by Morten Rasmussen, an immigrant from Denmark who converted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and arrived in Ephraim, Utah in 1851, before moving to Mount Pleasant with other Mormon settlers in 1859.[2] Rasmussen lived in this house, designed in the Federal architectural style, with his wife, n√©e Karen Marie Christiansen, also an immigrant from Denmark, and their twelve children.[2] He was a missionary in his native Denmark from 1881 to 1883,[3] and he died in 1885.[2] The house has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since August 18, 1977.[1]\n\nThis article about a property in Sanpete County, Utah on the National Register of Historic Places is a stub.
