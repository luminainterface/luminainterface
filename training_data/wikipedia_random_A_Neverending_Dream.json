  "content": "\"A Neverending Dream\" is a 1996 song by German group X-Perience, released as the second single from their debut album, Magic Fields (1996). It charted in Germany, Hungary and Switzerland and was the band's biggest hit. The song entered the German Singles Chart at number 91, went to number four in October/November 1996, and spent over 18 weeks in the charts. Over 350,000 copies of the singles were sold in Germany and the single was eventually certified Gold. On the Eurochart Hot 100, \"A Neverending Dream\" peaked at number 29 in December 1996. A music video was also produced to promote the single.\n\nPan-European magazine Music & Media wrote about the song: \"...the uptempo A Neverending Dream, earlier released as a single, is pure pop with a simple synthesizers and dramatic melodies, which is perfect for EHR.\"[1]\n\nOn the album Magic Fields, the song has a longer interlude between verse 2 and 3, so this version is 3:45 long. During 1996 and 1997 the band played the song on various television shows. For some reasons, they performed a short version of \"A Neverending Dream\" sometimes which was only approximately 2:30 long (without the 3rd verse and repeated refrain at the end).\n\nIn 2006 the band re-recorded the song on their 4th album Lost in Paradise. José Alvarez-Brill remixed the song. The remake is called \"A Neverending Dream\" (Alvarez Album Edit) – 3:37. An instrumental version of this 2006 version was used to find a new singer, when Claudia Uhle left the band in July 2007. This was released on the 2007-single \"I Feel Like You\".[7]\n\nA completely new recorded and composed version of \"A Neverending Dream\" is released on the album \"555\". This version (3:31) was released as third single of the album \"555\" on 3 July 2020.[8] The Deluxe Edition of \"555\" contains the 1994 Original Demo Version of \"A Neverending Dream\" (3:17), too.[9]\n\nIn 2006, the song was covered by German dance music act Cascada. This song appears on their 2006 debut album, Everytime We Touch. It was the fifth single released in Germany by Cascada in 2006. It was Cascada's 4th UK single. The video for this song was released on 11 May 2007 on the music channels Fizz and The Box. The music video is strongly themed on Middle Eastern culture with singer Natalie Horler dancing in traditional clothing in front of backdrops like the desert, a typical harem and hammam. Despite a good top 15 position in Ireland, in the UK it charted at #46 on its first week of physical release, a big disappointment considering that all previous singles in the UK had gone top 10.\n",
