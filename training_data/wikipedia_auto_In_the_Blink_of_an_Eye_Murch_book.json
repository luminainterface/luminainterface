  "content": "In the Blink of an Eye: A Perspective on Film Editing is a 1992 non-fiction filmmaking book on the art and craft of editing authored by Walter Murch.  The book suggests editors prioritize emotion over the pure technicalities of editing.  According to The Film Stage, the book “is often considered the essential literary source on film editing.”[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\nThe book is based on a transcription of a lecture Murch gave about editing in 1988. In 2001, it was revised to reflect changes in digital editing.[7]\n\nIn particular, Murch uses his experience editing The English Patient to explore the digital side of editing.\n\nMuch of the book references experiences Murch had editing The English Patient, Apocalypse Now, and The Godfather.\n\nThis article about a non-fiction book on film is a stub.
