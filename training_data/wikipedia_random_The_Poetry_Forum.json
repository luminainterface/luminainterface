  "content": "The Poetry Forum, Inc.,[1] \nbegan in 1973[1] to arrange poetry workshops in the Deerfield, Illinois, area.[2] In 1976, Suzanne Brabant and others founded the journal, RHINO Poetry, as an outlet for its workshop members' poems.[3]  The Poetry Forum moved to the Evanston, Illinois area around 1999, where The Poetry Forum's workshops are still held monthly. The Forum extended its workshops to central Illinois from 2002-2007. The Illinois Arts Council awarded The Poetry Forum grants for operating costs in 2007,[4] 2008,[5] and 2009.[6] The Poetry Forum was founded by Suzanne Brabant,[7] Lowell B. Komie,[8] and Elizabeth Peterson.[2] In 2005, Helen Degen Cohen (Halina Degenfisz),[9] took over the Forum's mission of creating monthly workshops and readings for Evanston's poets.\n",
