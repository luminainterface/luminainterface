  "content": "The Argonne Building is a historic building located in Des Moines, Iowa, United States. It was built in 1919 and it was used as a  showroom for the Ford automobile plant that was located across the street and for employee housing. In later years it served as a long-term hotel and as an apartment building for low-income renters. There are plans to convert most of the building into market-rate apartments and to maintain the commercial space on the main level.[2] The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020.[1]\n\nThis article about a property in Polk County, Iowa on the National Register of Historic Places is a stub.
