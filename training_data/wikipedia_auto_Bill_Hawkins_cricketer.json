He eventually became editor and manager of the Pahiatua Herald.[1] After losing his parliamentary seat he moved to Tataraimaka in Taranaki, where he took up farming.[1]\n\nHawkins played 17 first-class matches for Auckland and Hawke's Bay between 1887 and 1896.[2] He was a wicket-keeper who also sometimes bowled left-arm medium pace.[3] He captained Hawke's Bay in their match against Wellington in 1887–88.[4]\n\nHawkins won the Pahiatua electorate in a 1904 by-election after the death of John O'Meara; but was defeated in the next election in 1905.[5] At the 1914 general election he stood in the Stratford seat as the official Liberal Party candidate. He was defeated by the incumbent MP John Bird Hine.[6]\n\nIn World War I he served overseas in the 14th Reinforcement with the rank of captain.[1][7] On his return he joined the staff of the prohibitionist organisation the New Zealand Alliance.[1]\n\nHawkins died in New Plymouth on 10 August 1930,[1] and he was buried at Te Henui Cemetery.[8] He was survived by his wife, whom he had married in 1894, and their four sons and a daughter.[1]\n",
