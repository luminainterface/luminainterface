  "content": "\nThis is a list of player transfers involving Premiership Rugby teams before or during the 2025–26 season.\n\nThe list consists of deals that have been confirmed, and are for players who are moving either from or to one of the 10 rugby union clubs which competed in the Premiership during the 2024–25 season.[1] The winner of the 2024–25 RFU Championship will be included on the list, in place of the bottom-ranked Premiership club from the 2024–25 season. This is subject to the Championship club meeting the RFU's minimum standards criteria,[2] then winning the promotion/relegation play-offs.[3]\n\nIt is not unknown for confirmed deals to be cancelled at a later date.[4]\n",
