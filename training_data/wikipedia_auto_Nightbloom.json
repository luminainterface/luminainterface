  "content": "Nightbloom is the collaborative album by ambient musicians Steve Roach and Mark Seelig, containing Mark's vocal and Tuva-style overtoning, combining Steve's zones and grooves. The disc features five seamless parts, single-track composition.[1][3]\n\nThe first track features a slow rising and falling bass tone for the first eight minutes until a subtle percussion pattern begins to emerge slowly from deep in the mix. The second track brings a drumming loop, further laden with echo as the main drones continue steadily. The third track subtly the drones and the drums with a slow martial summoning, as does the fourth track. The final track strips away the drumming for the first part because a final, helping to sum up and send out the album on a strong note.\n\nAllMusic rated the album a 3.5 of 5, saying \"it's enjoyable more than remarkable, but Roach and Seelig are nothing if not listenable composers for a variety of moods\".\n\nHypnagogue highly rated the album, saying \"Nightbloom has taken me to amazing places and shown me incredible things every time Iâ€™ve listened\".\n\nAdapted from Discogs[4]\n",
