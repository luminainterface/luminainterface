  "content": "The Pilot and Transcript was a daily Whig newspaper published in Baltimore, MD from April 2, 1840 to January 25, 1841.[1] The paper was briefly titled \"The Pilot\" before being renamed \"The Pilot and Transcript\".\n\nDuff Green established The Pilot and Transcript to support the Harrison-Tyler presidential ticket. While the paper was initially successful in supporting the campaign, Green soon got caught up in a religious controversy about the influence of the Catholic Church in politics.[2] Maryland Whigs grew uncomfortable with the controversy and withdrew their support of the Pilot leading to the paper's end in 1841.[1]\n",
