There is a true romantic and honest side to it which will have you reminiscing and reflecting on past and current relationships and people in your life.\"[3]\n\nJB Hi-Fi said \"the bare-bones ballad talks of struggle from the outside, draping the stark, aching admission, 'when you break, I break”', over an understated piano arrangement.\"[4]\n\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n",
