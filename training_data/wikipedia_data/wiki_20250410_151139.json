It came to Copenhagen in 1810.\nThere are several holes on the runestone, but no one knows why. Ragnhild, who raised the runestone, also had Glavendrup stone (DR 209) made after another husband named Alle. That runestone is located at a barrow and a stone ship in Glavendrup on the island of Funen. Both the Glavendrup and Tryggev\u00e6lde runestones were made by the same runemaster, Sote.\nThe inscription ends with a curse against anyone who would destroy or move the runestone that is similar to the ones found on the Glavendrup stone the S\u00f8nder Vinge runestone 2 and the Glemminge stone and the Saleby Runestone in Sweden.
