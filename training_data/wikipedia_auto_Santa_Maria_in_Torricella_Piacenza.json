This church was used to provide religious consolation to those condemned to death (the scaffold was near the square). This service was provided by the Capuchins order, established in the church by Bishop Burali to take the role from the Confraternity of San Giovanni. The first church was enlarged in the mid-seventeenth century. The church has a canvas of a Beato Paolo Burali by Gaspare Landi, a Crucifixon by Robert de Longe, and a St Disma by Giuseppe Gherardi.[1]\n",
