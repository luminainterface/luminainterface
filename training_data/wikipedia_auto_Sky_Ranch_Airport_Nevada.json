It has two runways: 3/21 is 3,340 by 45 feet (1,018 x 14 m) with an asphalt surface and 12/30 is 3,300 by 105 feet (1,006 x 32 m) with a dirt surface.[1]\n\nFor the 12-month period ending July 26, 2022, the airport had  a total of 4,960 aircraft operations, 4,720 general aviation aircraft operations, 180 military aircraft operations, and 60 air taxi aircraft operations, an average of 95 per week.
