  "content": "Dutton Park railway station is located on the Beenleigh line in Queensland, Australia. It serves the Brisbane suburb of Dutton Park.  The station is one of the oldest on the network.[1]\n\nTo the west of the station lies the NSW North Coast dual gauge line primarily used by Gold Coast, NSW TrainLink XPT and freight services.[2]\n\nDutton Park station opened in 1884 as Boggo Junction. It was the junction of the Wooloongabba line from 1884 until 1989. The Boggo Junction station is shown on the 1911 estate map for the Dutton Park Estate.[3] The station was renamed Dutton Park three years later in 1914.[4][5][6]\n\nIn September 1930, the standard gauge New South Wales North Coast line opened to the west of the station.[7] In 1995, as part of the construction of the Gold Coast line, the standard gauge line was converted to dual gauge.[8]\n\nIn early 2014, it was announced that Dutton Park would be closed if the Bus & Train Tunnel proceeded, because it would reduce the overall cost of the project, principally by ensuring that no surface-level private residential property acquisition would be required.[9][10]\n\nIn June 2014, it was announced that by slightly increasing the gradient of the line, the project could proceed without the need to demolish Dutton Park station.[11][12][13] The project was cancelled in March 2015.[14]\n\nThe station is being relocated and receiving a major upgrade as part of Cross River Rail.[1] The new station design has easier access for people using wheelchairs or walking frames, and parents with prams.[1] New entry points to station will be built from Noble Street, Kent Street and Annerley Road.[1] By 1 May 2023 the old Dutton Park station had been completely demolished.[15] The new station is located entirely south of Annerley Road, and features two side-facing platforms on the eastern side of the corridor; something different to anywhere else on the QLD network and a variance to the other stations being built by Cross River Rail, and it re-opened on 21 October 2024.[16][17]\n\nDutton Park station is served by all stops Beenleigh line services from Beenleigh, Kuraby and Coopers Plains to Bowen Hills and Ferny Grove.[18]\n\nUntil June 2011, Dutton Park was also served by services to Corinda via the Yeerongpilly-Corinda line.[19][20]\n",
