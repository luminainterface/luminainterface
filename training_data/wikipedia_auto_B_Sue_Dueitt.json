A Leakesville, Mississippi native, she moved to the Washington, D.C. area in 1977 to begin a job at the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare; later that year, she joined the United States Army Reserve. In June 1997, she became the first woman in the Army Reserve outside of the Nurse Corps to be promoted to brigadier general.\n\nDueitt was born in Leakesville, Mississippi and grew up in nearby McLain.[1] She graduated from McLain High School in 1964, after which she attended the University of Southern Mississippi, graduating from the latter institution in three years.[2]\n\nShe received a PhD in administration from the University of Alabama and performed other graduate work at American University and the United States Army War College.\n\nDueitt moved to the Washington, D.C. area in 1977 to work for the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

Stennis convinced her to commission as a reserve military officer.[2] By 1997, Dueitt was a colonel in the Army's Adjutant General's Corps and deputy chief of public affairs at Army headquarters in The Pentagon. In June of that year, she was promoted to brigadier general, becoming the first female general officer in the Army Reserve not from the Nurse Corps.[1][3]\n\nDueitt retired from the Army in 2005 and works as a consultant.\n",
