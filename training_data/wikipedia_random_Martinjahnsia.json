  "content": "Martinjahnsia is a single-species fungal genus in the family Teloschistaceae.[2] It contains the sole species Martinjahnsia resendei, a saxicolous (rock-dwelling) crustose lichen.\n\nThis species was first scientifically described in 1968 by Josef Poelt and Carlos das Neves Tavares, who initially classified it in the genus Xanthoria.[3] In 2003, Sergey Kondratyuk and Ingvar KÃ¤rnefelt proposed to transfer the species to the genus Rusavskia.[4] Kondratyuk and colleagues suggested in 2012 that it be placed in a new genus, Martinjahnsia, to accommodate its unique phylogenetic position. The genus name honours German lichenologist Martin Jahns.[5]\n\nMartinjahnsia resendei has a Mediterranean distribution. The lichen is abundant in the southeast of Spain, where it colonises sunny rock surfaces, especially those enriched in nitrates.[6] In islands of the Tuscan Archipelago, it is typically found on sun-exposed siliceous rocks on the Mediterranean coast.[7]\n\nThere are several lichen products that have been isolated and chemically characterised from Martinjahnsia resendei. These include peroxyergosterol, the anthraquinone pigments physcion, fallacinal, and fallacinol, and  three new unidentified hopene-type triterpenes.[8]\n",
