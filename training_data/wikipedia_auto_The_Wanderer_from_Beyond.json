  "content": "The Wanderer from Beyond (Le voyageur de l'au-delà : The Time Runaways #2) is a novel by Philippe Ebly published in France in 1978.\n\nWhile trekking in the Cévennes, Thierry, Didier, and Kouroun are told by a young coffee shop tender about a ravine where unknown and dangerous forces are hiding. To prove that there is, in fact, nothing mysterious there, Thierry suggests to his companions that they set up camp in the ravine.\n\nOnce there, they discover an incomplete circle of moonstones and a half-erased warning engraved in the stone wall. The night passes relatively untroubled, but the next day, the sun simply will not rise, and the ravine is engulfed in a thick fog. Nevertheless, the three friends try to continue their trek, only to soon discover that the ravine has entrapped them.\n\nAfter fruitlessly trying to escape, they resign themselves to doing what is obviously expected of them: completing the circle of moonstones, and seeing what—or rather who—happens...\n\nThis article about a speculative fiction novel of the 1970s is a stub.
