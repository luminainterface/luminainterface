  "content": "Vagus Vetus is the sixth studio album by Czech black metal band Master's Hammer, released on 18 May 2014 through the band's own record label, Jihosound Records, founded the year prior.[1] It is the group's second concept album so far, the first one being Jilemnický okultista, released in 1992.\n\nThe album tells the surreal adventures of an imaginary old wanderer, whose name is Vagus Vetus, through an \"unfamiliar labyrinth\" where \"there's nothing good waiting for him. Disgusted with progress and modernity of all kinds, he enjoys listening to Aeolian harps and sounds of postmortal flatulence. He finds his consolation in hedonic experiences of natural origin\".[2]\n\nThe track \"Panuška\" is a tribute to Czech painter Jaroslav Panuška (1872–1958).\n\nAll lyrics are written by Franta Štorm; all music is composed by Master's Hammer (Štorm, Necrocock and Silenthell)",
