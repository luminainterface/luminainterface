The sexual fruiting bodies are furfuraceous and usually seated at the base of a reddish synnemata.[1][3] It is a monotypic genus containing the sole species Corallonectria jatrophae.[1][2] This species was formerly classified under Corallomycetella.[1]\n\nThis Hypocreales-related article is a stub.
