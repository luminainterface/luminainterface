  "content": "Namesake is an album led by trumpeter Dennis González which was recorded in 1987 and released on the Swedish Silkheart label.[1][2]\n\nComparing it with González previous album, The Penguin Guide to Jazz notes \"Namesake only suffers by comparison, but it shouldn't be missed\".[4] In his review for AllMusic, Brian Olewnick states \"Namesake doesn't really happen, and it's hard to pinpoint exactly why – the all-Gonzalez-originals are essentially heads to set up solos rather than fully fleshed-out ensemble passages. And while those solos are almost all strong, the music resolutely remains less than the sum of the parts\".[3]\n\nAll compositions by Dennis González except where noted.\n",
