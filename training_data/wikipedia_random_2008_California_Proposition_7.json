In order to make that goal, levels of production of solar, wind and other renewable energy resources would more than quadruple from their current[when?] output of 10.9%.[1] It would also require California utilities to increase their purchase of electricity generated from renewable resources by 2% annually to meet Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements of 40% in 2020 and 50% in 2025.  Current law AB32 requires an RPS of 20% by 2010.\n\nThe 42 page measure, 7 pages of which is new law, is an initiated state statute that had qualified for the November 2008 ballot in California,[2] and was disapproved by voters on November 4 of that year.\n\nThe California Legislative Analyst's Office, the nonpartisan state agency charged with providing a neutral estimate about the fiscal impact on the state of ballot initiatives and state legislative bills, has arrived at the following summary of Prop. 7's estimated costs:\n\nThe official committee supporting Prop 7 is called Californians for Solar and Clean Energy.\n\nFor the full list of supporters, see: List of Proposition 7 supporters\n\nThe primary financial backer of the initiative is Peter Sperling.\n\nAs of September 18, two donors have contributed $5,000 or more to support Prop. 7.

Specifically, proponents sued over the opponents' claim that small renewable providers would be shut out of the market.  Noting that there is no language in the measure that states that, Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Michael Kenny refused to take sides on the issue.[26]\n\nThe lawsuit filed by opponents of Proposition 7 wanted the removal of three statements in the voter's guide:\n\nThe opponent's petition was denied in its entirety, with Judge Kenny stating that the opponents had not sufficiently established that those statements were misleading.\n",
