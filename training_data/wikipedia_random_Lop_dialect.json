  "content": "Lop, also known as Lopnor or Lopnur is a Turkic dialect spoken in the Lopnor region of Xinjiang, China. Lop speakers are officially classified as ethnic Uyghurs by the Chinese government.\n\nLop belongs to the Karluk branch of Turkic languages, along with Uyghur and Uzbek. Its status as a distinct language from Uyghur is disputed. Although it has some features that differentiate it from standard Uyghur, it is considered by some linguists to be one of its dialects.[2]\n\nThis article about a Turkic language or related topic is a stub.
