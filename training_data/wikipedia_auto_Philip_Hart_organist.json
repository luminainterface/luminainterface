  "content": "Philip Hart (1674 or 1676 – 18 July 1749) was an English organist and composer.\n\nHis father, James Hart (1647–1718), was a gentleman of the Chapel Royal, chorister of Westminster Abbey, and a composer.[1]\n\nPhilip Hart was for many years organist of churches in London: he became assistant organist of St Andrew Undershaft in 1696, sole organist from 1697 until his death; he was organist of St Michael, Cornhill from 1704 to 1723. On 28 May 1724 he was elected the first organist of St Dionis Backchurch. He died, at an advanced age, on 17 July 1749, and was buried at St Andrew Undershaft on 22 July.[1][2][3]\n\nHart was said by the writer John Hawkins to have been a sound musician, but to have \"entertained little relish\" for innovations. Hawkins also described Hart's frequent use of the \"shake\" in playing, and recorded how he was wont to discourse on music at Thomas Britton's house in the company of Handel, Pepusch and others.[1]\n\nAttribution\n",
