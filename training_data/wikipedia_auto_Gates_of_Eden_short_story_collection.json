  "content": "Gates of Eden is a collection of short stories written by Ethan Coen, first published in 1998.[1][2][3]\n\nThe title comes from one of the stories in the book with reference to the biblical Garden of Eden. The stories within the book range from traditional fiction to stories formatted like a radio script.\n\nThere is an abridged version on audiobook which includes 11 of the 14 stories read by actors, many of whom have starred in Coen brothers films.[4][5][6]\n\nOne story in the collection was adapted into a short film, A Fever in the Blood, released in 2002 and directed by Andrew Pulver.[7]\n\nGates of Eden was well reviewed for its combination of strong dialogue, effective comedy, and darker, often violent subject matterâ€•elements Coen was known for in his films.[8] Several stories also focus on Jewish characters growing up near Minneapolis, where Coen is from, which a New York Times reviewer suspected of \"being at least grounded in autobiography.\"[2]\n",
