  "content": "GJ 3929 b (Gliese 3929 b, TOI-2013 b) is a confirmed exoplanet located 52 light-years away orbiting the red dwarf star GJ 3929.[3] It is an Earth-sized planet, having a radius only 9% larger than that of Earth.[4] It orbits its star at a distance of 0.0252 astronomical units (3,770,000Â km), being located in the Venus zone of its star, and completes one orbit around it every 2 days and 15 hours.[4] Because of the proximity of its star, and its low mass, GJ 3929 b is classified as a Venus-like planet, having an equilibrium temperature of around 300 Â°C and receiving planetary insolation 17 times more intense than Earth receives from the Sun.[4]\n\nInitially, the radius of GJ 3929 b was calculated at 1.15Â±0.04Â RðŸœ¨, and its mass at 1.21Â±0.42Â MðŸœ¨, giving a density of 4.4Â±1.6Â g/cm3.[5] Later, observations using the NEID spectrometer on the WIYN 3.5 m Telescope measured the planet's mass to be 1.75Â±0.45Â MðŸœ¨; and observations using the ARCTIC imager, plus photometry from TESS and LCOGT, constrained the planet's radius to 1.09Â±0.04Â RðŸœ¨, this time giving a higher density of 7.3Â±2Â g/cm3 (about 33% larger than Earth's[a]).[4] The characteristics of this planet make it similar to Earth in terms of mass and radius.\n\nGJ 3929 b orbits its star at a distance of 0.0252 astronomical units (3,770,000Â km), which makes it located in its host star's Venus zone, a region where rocky planets would have runaway greenhouse conditions like Venus.[4] GJ 3929 b completes an orbit around its star every 2 days, 14 hours and 47 minutes (2.616 days).[4]\n\nAs a terrestrial planet that orbits in the Venus zone of its star, GJ 3929 b classifies as a Venus-like planet, having a planetary equilibrium temperature of 295 Â°C and receiving planetary insolation 17 times greater than that of Earth receives from the Sun.[4]\n\nThe high density of GJ 3929 b does not suggest a dense atmosphere.[4] Atmospheric scenarios such as a thin atmosphere of volatiles, a thin atmosphere of silicate enriched in refractory elements, or even no atmosphere at all are plausible.[4] Due to its proximity to its star, GJ 3929 b has probably already lost much of its atmosphere since its formation.[4]\n\nGJ 3929 b is an excellent planet for atmospheric study with the James Webb Space Telescope.[4][5] The study of this planet's atmosphere can help reveal the evolutionary history of its planetary system, and provide more information about planetary formation models.[4]\n\nGJ 3929 b was discovered by a team of astronomers led by Jonas Kermer, from the Heidelberg University in Germany.[2] They reported a transit signal identified in the host star (GJ 3929)'s light curve detected by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).[2] Afterwards, the planetary nature of this transit signal was confirmed using radial velocity observations with the CARMENES spectrograph, in addition to transit observations made with SAINT-EX and LCOGT.[5][2] The discovery was announced in 2022.[1]\n\nThe radial velocity observation with CARMENES also helped discover another planet in the planetary system, GJ 3929 c, a sub-Neptune detected by radial velocity.[5]\n\nGJ 3929 is a red dwarf of spectral type M3.5V[7] that is located 51.6 light years from Earth, in the constellation Corona Borealis.[3][note 1] This star is smaller, cooler and less luminous than the Sun, having a radius of 0.32Â Râ˜‰, an effective temperature of 3,384Â K (3,111Â Â°C) and a luminosity equivalent to 1% of solar luminosity.[4] Its age is estimated between 2.2 and 11 billion years.[4]\n\nThe star also hosts another planet, called GJ 3929 c, a sub-Neptune orbits 3 times further than the innermost planet, at a distance of 0.081 astronomical units (12,100,000Â km),[5] but still below the habitable zone.[8]\n",
