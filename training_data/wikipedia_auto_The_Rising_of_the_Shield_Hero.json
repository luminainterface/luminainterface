  "content": "The Rising of the Shield Hero (Japanese: 盾の勇者の成り上がり, Hepburn: Tate no Yūsha no Nariagari) is a Japanese light novel series written by Aneko Yusagi. Originally published as a web novel in the user-generated novel site Shōsetsuka ni Narō, the series has since been published by Media Factory with an expanded story-line featuring illustrations by Seira Minami. As of June 25, 2019, 22 volumes have been published.\n\nThe novel series was adapted into a manga series by Aiya Kyū and published by Media Factory, with 27 tankōbon volumes released as of February 21, 2025. Both the novel and manga series were licensed by One Peace Books and were published in North America starting in September 2015. The 25-episode anime television series adaptation produced by Kinema Citrus aired from January to June 2019. A second season, co-produced by DR Movie, aired from April to June 2022. A third season aired from October to December 2023. A fourth season is set to premiere in July 2025.\n\nNaofumi Iwatani, an easygoing Japanese youth, was summoned into a parallel world along with three other young Japanese men from parallel universes to become the world's Cardinal Heroes and fight inter-dimensional hordes of monsters called Waves. Only by constantly fighting against the waves can they return to their own world. Each of the heroes were respectively equipped with their own legendary equipment when summoned. Naofumi happened to receive the Legendary Shield, the sole defensive equipment, while the other heroes received respectively a sword, a spear, and a bow, weapons meant for attack. Furthermore, the \"status magic\" all four also have make it like they are in a computer game, except Naofumi is the only member of the group who hasn't played one. Because of these differences, he quickly is considered weak, and so as the other heroes are fully supported by the kingdom and gain several strong allies each, Naofumi's luck turns to the worse after his single companion, revealed to be the kingdom's princess, betrays him, steals all his belongings, and leaves him devoid of all assistance and supplies by framing him of sexually assaulting her.\n\nMocked by the nobility and shunned by everyone from his fellow heroes to peasants, a now cynical Naofumi, with nothing but his legendary equipment and current outfit that he bought prior, is forced to train as a hero alone while working to make ends meet, until he buys from a slave trader a young tanuki demi-human girl named Raphtalia, and later an egg that hatches into a bird-like monster whom he names \"Filo\", both quickly growing into adulthood and becoming powerful warriors under his care. As they little by little gain the trust and gratitude of the people with their heroic actions, Naofumi and his companions work together to carry out their mission as saviors as they unravel the mystery of the Waves and the reason why they are a threat not only to their world, but to other worlds as well. This is not a story about revenge in another world, nor is it a story about how a hero is born, but a story about mutual redemption after establishing connections with companions.\n\nOriginally published as a web novel, the series has been re-written with an expanded story-line.

Several Anime News Network reviewers criticized the show for its framing of a false rape accusation,[53] and the protagonist purchasing a girl as a slave was controversial.[54][55] When the show's producer Junichiro Tamura was asked about it, he responded that there \"have not been any controversies regarding the series in Japan, so it is difficult to say. In the case there were any controversy domestically, we will try to address all issues with the staff and people involved to bring our customers a better product the next time.\"[56]\n\nReviews of subsequent episodes have been generally positive. Theron Martin of Anime News Network gave a rating of B− for the first two episodes, stating \"the series looks like it's gotten over its initial problematic hump and should hopefully slide into a more agreeable story flow.\"[57] He gave a B+ rating for the third episode, stating that \"the series seems like it's angling to build Naofumi up more as a folk hero than the famously brazen heroes we're used to seeing in fantasy stories\" and that \"episode 3 gives the best argument to date for the series' possible potential.\"[58]\n\nThe second season received heavy scrutiny from both the audience[59] and reviewers[60] due to its fast pacing and changes to the source material.\n",
