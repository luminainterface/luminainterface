  "content": "During the Venezuelan presidential crisis concerning the legitimate President of Venezuela, reactions and responses to the crisis were greatly divided.[1]\n\nOn 10 January 2019, Venezuela's opposition-majority National Assembly declared that incumbent Nicolás Maduro's 2018 reelection was invalid, and its president, Juan Guaidó, said that he was prepared to assume the acting presidency.[2][3] On 23 January 2019, Guaidó and the National Assembly declared he was acting president, who took the presidential oath.[4] By vote of the opposition coalition that had previously supported Guaidó's claim, the Guaidó interim government dissolved on 5 January 2023.\n\nSome countries and organizations recognized Guaidó as acting president, while others recognized Maduro; some expressed neutrality, and some supported the National Assembly without endorsing Guaidó.\n\nAfter Maduro's inauguration in January, United States National Security Advisor John Bolton, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called him an illegitimate dictator.[5][6][7]\n\nInternational demonstrations occurred on both sides. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans protested in more than 70 cities around the world in support of Guaidó,[8][9][10][11][12] and demonstrations in support of Maduro also took place.[13][14][15]\n\n Argentina: During the presidency of Mauricio Macri, Argentina recognized Guaidó as the legitimate President of Venezuela and repeatedly denounced Maduro as a 'dictatorship'.[16] After the 2019 elections, when Alberto Fernández took office, Argentina stopped recognizing Guaidó as President and withdrew credentials to his ambassador in the country. Argentina, however, refused to recognize Nicolás Maduro's envoy as well.[17][18] After Guaidó and other opposition representatives were refused entry into the National Assembly in January 2020, Argentina labeled the move by Maduro's supporters as \"unacceptable\".[19][20] In a July 2020 report by the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights, Argentina toughened its position on the Maduro's government and signed a petition for fresh elections and denounced violations to human rights in the country.[21]\n\n Brazil: Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said that he would do all he could to \"re-establish order, democracy and freedom\" in Venezuela.[22] The Bolsonaro administration declared on 12 January 2019 that it recognizes Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela.[23]\n\n Canada: During a town hall at Brock University at St. Catharines, Ontario, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, denounced Maduro as an 'illegitimate dictator' and said anyone should stand up and condemn the Maduro government, which he said has been responsible for \"terrible oppression\" and a humanitarian crisis unseen in South America for decades.[24][25]\n\n China: China was originally forthright in lending support to Maduro with Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying stating that China \"supports efforts made by the Venezuelan government to protect the country's sovereignty, independence, and stability\" and \"opposes foreign forces from interfering into Venezuela affairs\".[26][27] In early February there were reports of China beginning to take a more neutral position for fear of alienating potential relationships with major South American countries who support Guaidó, and also possibly due to frustration with Venezuela's inability to repay the debt it owed, China having lent Venezuela US$67 billion. Geng Shuang, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, stated that China's trade deals would not be affected \"no matter how circumstances change,\" and further stated that China has been in talks with \"all sides\".[28][29] There also has been evidence of discontent in China's public over the amounts of money that have been given to Venezuela, which some state would be better used in China.[30] According to the Wall Street Journal, China has been holding meetings with diplomats from the government of Guaidó to discuss Chinese investments in Venezuela;[31] a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman denied these claims, stating that it is \"false information\".[32] On 8 March, Foreign Minister Wang Yi reaffirmed China's opposition to the issued sanctions, and support for dialogue between Venezuela's opposition and government.[33] On 5 June, Chinese President Xi Jinping said that his country is ready to work with the international community to play a constructive role with Venezuela and help the country to get back on a normal development path as soon as possible while opposing foreign interference, unilateral sanctions, the use of force, or threats of the use of force when it comes to the current situation.[34] Moreover, President Xi said that the current crisis should be solved by the ruling party and the opposition through inclusive political dialogue and consultation within the framework of Venezuela's constitution.[35]\n\n Iran: Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman stated that Iran \"supports Venezuela's [Maduro] government and nation against any kind of foreign interference in its internal affairs\".[36]\n\n Russia: Russia has been a vocal supporter of Nicolás Maduro, as well as being a military and economic ally since under predecessor Hugo Chávez.[37] Russia has made shows of force, such as flying two Tu-160 nuclear capable bombers to Venezuela.[37] In addition to direct support Russia also acts vocal supporter of Maduro in the UN, and has been one of the country's principal arms dealers.[38] Domestic reactions in Russia to the situation have been mixed with some publications praising Russia's support of Maduro and its willingness to confront the US, and others criticizing economic aid to Venezuela which they deem an economic black hole.[37] The Russian national oil company Rosneft has invested heavily in numerous joint ventures with Venezuela's state-run oil company, PDVSA. Rosneft has made direct investments in six Venezuelan oil fields totaling around US$2.5 billion.[39] Rosneft has also acted as a major lender, and oil marketer for Venezuela aiding it in selling 225,000 barrels per day in crude supplies overseas. It has made large loans to the company with US$2.7 billion outstanding; to offset risk PDVSA has pledged a 49.9% stake of subsidiary Citgo as collateral for loans outstanding.[40] On 5 June 2019, following talks with China's President Xi Jinping, President Vladimir Putin wished the situation in Venezuela to stabilize.[41]\n\n Turkey: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan phoned Maduro to offer support.[42] According to Haaretz, \"Erdogan pledged to invest in Venezuelan's failing economy during the trip, with Maduro saying that Turkish businesses would pump some 4.5 billion euros into the country.\"[43][44] On 1 April, Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu told his Venezuelan counterpart Jorge Arreaza that Turkey will continue supporting the Maduro government and deepen its cooperation \"in all fields\" despite pressure from the United States.[45][46] However, in August 2019, Ziraat Bank, Turkey's largest bank by assets, stopped offering services to the Central Bank of Venezuela.[47]\n\n United States (US): On 15 January, US President Donald Trump was reported to be deliberating whether to officially recognize Guaidó,[48] which he did on 23 January.[49][50][51] US Vice President Mike Pence released a video on 23 January in support of Guaidó and the people of Venezuela.[52][53] The US was the first nation to recognize Guaidó after he swore an oath on the 23rd, with Trump and Pence sending their support and solidarity as well as the official recognition; other countries followed suit.[54] In response Maduro ordered the expulsion of US diplomats, giving them 72 hours to leave Venezuela. The US said it would not close its embassy, stating their diplomatic relationship was with Guaidó's government, and holding Maduro responsible for the safety of its staff.[54][55][56] On 26 January 2019, only hours before the deadline, the Maduro government backtracked on its expulsion order, giving US diplomats another 30 days.[57] Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appointed Elliott Abrams as US Special Envoy to Venezuela.[58] On 28 January, the US imposed sanctions on PDVSA. The US accounted for 41% of purchases from the company, which is the biggest input to Venezuela's economy.[59] On 22 February—the same day as the Venezuela Aid Live concert, which Maduro said was part of an effort to topple him—Venezuela extended the deadline for US diplomats to leave by another 30 days.[60] On 12 March, the US announced that it was withdrawing its diplomats from Caracas.[61] The United States stopped recognizing Guaidó's presidential claim in January 2023, following the vote of opposition groups to dissolve the interim government. A spokesperson for the White House and State Department said that the US \"recognized the National Assembly elected in 2015, which Guaidó had led, as Venezuela's 'only remaining democratically elected institution'.\"[62]\n\n Vatican City: Corriere della Sera cited[63] a leaked copy[64][65] of a private letter reportedly sent by Pope Francis to Maduro on 7 February 2019[66] in reply to a letter Maduro wrote asking the pope to mediate.[67] Pope Francis' response—addressed to \"His Excellency Mr Nicolás Maduro Moros\"[63]—said that what had been agreed in earlier negotiations had not been followed.[66] Those conditions, still applicable, were: open a channel for humanitarian aid, hold free elections, free political prisoners, and re-establish the constitutionally-elected National Assembly.[68] According to Andrea Gagliarducci, writing for the Catholic News Agency, in not addressing Maduro as president, the Pope was agreeing with the stance taken by the Venezuelan bishops,[68] who held that Maduro's election was illegitimate.[69]\n\n European Union (EU): More than half of its member states, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Spain, said they support Guaidó;[70][71] earlier, the EU issued a declaration saying it \"fully supports the National Assembly as the democratically elected institution whose powers need to be restored and respected\".[72] On 4 February 19 countries of the European Union made a joint declaration supporting and recognizing Juan Guaidó as acting president of Venezuela, asking that he \"summons free, just and democratic presidential elections\".[73] Italy's stance prevented this from becoming an official EU position.[74] The EU condemned the Constituent Assembly stripping of Guaidó's parliamentary immunity, calling the action a \"serious violation of the Venezuelan constitution, as well as of the rule of law and separation of power\".[75] The EU's recognition of Guaidó's presidency was withdrawn (although it was never declared by the whole EU block in the first place because Italy vetoed)[76][77] in January 2021. The United Kingdom, which left the EU the previous year, continued to recognize him,[78] and the European Parliament reaffirmed its recognition of Guaidó as president.[79][80]\n\nLima Group: On 11 and 12 January, several nations of the Lima Group released statements independent from the international body, including their nations' agreement to not recognize Maduro.[81][82][83] The Maduro government said that these countries had \"rectified\" themselves to support him as president.[81][84] They had not; the non-intervention statements were seen as a concession to prevent rash action by Maduro after he broadly threatened the group.[81][83] Venezuelan Foreign Minister, Jorge Arreaza, gave a different statement to the vice presidential office, saying that Venezuela had received diplomatic notices from some Lima Group countries about the original dispute.[81] Colombia's statement reiterated the group's resolution and pledged to support \"the restoration of democracy and constitutional order in Venezuela\", as well as saying that they did not have a position on the territorial dispute.[82] Arreaza contradicted the statement from his vice president's office that the Lima Group recognized Maduro's government, and doubled Maduro's 48-hour demand period for non-intervention for the remaining countries after it expired. He also advocated peaceful diplomatic discussion with neighboring countries.[85] The group—except for Mexico, which called for non-intervention in Venezuelan internal affairs[86]—continued to back the Guaidó government, with the Foreign Minister of Chile pledging \"unlimited support\".[87]\n\nInternational Conference on the Situation in Venezuela: Mexico and Uruguay announced an international conference for countries with a neutral position in Montevideo on 7 February.[88] Uruguay has since recognized Maduro as president, with foreign minister Rodolfo Nin Novoa comparing the worsening situation to the United States' rationale for the Iraq War.[89][a] In April, Beatriz Becerra said that the international conference had been of no use, given that there had been no progress on the 90-day deadline for elections that the group established when it was formed; she stated that the Contact Group should be terminated and efforts should be coordinated through the Lima Group.[93]\n\n Mercosur: During a July 2019 summit in Santa Fe, Argentina, the bloc called for \"free, fair and transparent presidential elections, as soon as possible\" in Venezuela. The presidents of the four member countries signed a statement expressing concern \"for the grave crisis that Venezuela is going through, which is seriously affecting the humanitarian situation and human rights.\"[94] Venezuela's membership of the bloc has been suspended indefinitely since 1 December 2016 in response to the \"rupture of the democratic order\" in that country.[95][96]\n\n Organization of American States (OAS): The OAS approved a resolution on 10 January 2019 \"to not recognize the legitimacy of Nicolas Maduro's new term\".[97] Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the OAS, recognized Guaidó on 23 January.[98] In an extraordinary OAS session called for 24 January 16 countries including the US recognized Guaidó as president, but they did not achieve the majority needed for a resolution.[99] Almagro held countries who remained neutral on the presidential crisis responsible for the massacre, suffering, and human rights violations in Venezuela.[100] In October 2022, a bloc of leftist OAS member states led a motion to remove Tarre's representation in the organization. Out of 35 members, 19 nations voted in favor of the motion and 4 against. The motion fell short of the 24 votes required for a two-thirds majority.[101]\n\n United Nations (UN): A special meeting of the Security Council was held on 26 January 2019 to discuss Venezuela; no consensus was reached. Secretary General António Guterres called for dialogue to ease tensions.[102] Delegates from Maduro's government continued to represent Venezuela at the United Nations.[103] On 28 February the Security Council voted on two draft resolutions: one from the US calling for new elections in Venezu",
