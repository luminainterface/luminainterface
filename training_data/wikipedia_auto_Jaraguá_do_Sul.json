The city was originally named just Jaraguá, but it was later renamed to Jaraguá do Sul due to a city already named Jaraguá in Goiás state.[3]\n\nJaraguá means Lord of the Valley in a Tupi–Guarani language. It was the name given by the indigenous population of the city to the Boa Vista Hill (Morro da Boa Vista).[4]\n\nIt borders Campo Alegre and São Bento do Sul to the north; Blumenau, Massaranduba, Pomerode and Rio dos Cedros to the south; Guaramirim, Joinville and Schroeder to the east and Corupá to the west.\n\nThe Itapocu River is Jaraguá do Sul's important river, crossing the city, being Jaraguá River and Itapocuzinho River its main affluents.\n\nThe climate is considered temperate, with average annual temperature around 21 °C. In summer temperatures often exceed 35 °C, although they may reach 40 °C in a few days. The winter is relatively cold for Brazilian standards, with an average minimum temperature around 12 °C in the months of June and July. Frosts occur almost every winter. Zero temperatures are rare, and that mark was reached most recently on July 14, 2000. The lowest temperature occurred on July 19, 1975, when thermometers recorded −2 °C. The highest temperature ever recorded was 42.5 °C on January 3, 1973.\n\nMalwee/Jaraguá, formerly known as Associação Desportiva Jaraguá, is a successful futsal club, which have won the national league twice. In 2007, the city's arena, named Arena Jaraguá, hosted the final matches of the Grand Prix de Futsal.[5] The arena also hosted two Ultimate Fighting Championship events, UFC on FX 8 in 2013 and UFC Fight Night 36 in 2014.\n\nThe city's football (soccer) club is Grêmio Esportivo Juventus. The retired goalkeeper Eduardo Roberto Stinghen, nicknamed Ado, was born in the city in 1946. Also, Filipe Luís, who previously played for Flamengo, was born in the city.\n\nThe local economy is mainly based in metallurgy and clothing industries. The city was the origin for several worldwide companies, like WEG (electric motors and industrial electronics), Marisol (clothing), Duas Rodas (food seasoning), Malwee (clothing), Menegotti (construction equipment) and many others. The city is the 7th largest economy of the state.[6]\n\nJaraguá do Sul is home to the Festival de Música de Santa Catarina (FEMUSC) which was created by Alex Klein.  The festival is held in late January and attracts students and faculty from all over the world. The program involves faculty and students recitals, orchestral and band performances, lessons and masterclasses.\n[7]\n\nThe Schützenfest (also known in Brazil as Festa dos Atiradores) is a traditional festival held annually since 1988, celebrated in October in Jaraguá do Sul. It is part of the popular festivals celebrated in that month in Santa Catarina state due to the German colonization in the region.[8]\n\nThe first inhabitants of the city were the indigenous people of the Xokleng and the Kaingang.[9] Later the following ethnic groups immigrated to the city: Germans, Hungarians, Italians, Poles, and Africans, who were brought to the city as slaves.[10]\nBy 2002 City Hall research concluded that 45% of the people from Jaraguá do Sul are descended from Germans. The other main groups were Italians (25%), Poles (6%), and Hungarians (3%); 21% had other ancestry.[33]\n\nBairros in Jaraguá do Sul.:[11]\n",
