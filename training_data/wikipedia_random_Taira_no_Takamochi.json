  "content": "Taira no Takamochi (平高望), born Prince Takamochi (高望王), was a former member of the Imperial Family demoted to nobility of the Heian period. He is the founder of the Taira clan and the Kanmu Heishi lineage of the clan.\n\nPrince Takamochi was born as the son of Prince Takami, the third prince of Prince Kazurawara, and Tachibana no Harunari. Takamochi was the great-grandson of Emperor Kanmu, who reigned from 781 to 806.[1][2]\n\nHe was granted the court rank of Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade and served as Vice Governor (suke kokushi) of Kazusa Province.[2]\n\nOn May 13, 889, Takamochi was granted the surname Taira, thus establishing the Kanmu Heishi line of the Taira clan. This line proved to be the strongest and most dominant line during the Heian period.[1]\n\nEven after his retirement, he stayed in Kazusa Province and became a powerful figure in the Kantō region as a feudal lord, privately owning vast rice fields.[2]\n\nTaira no Korihira, a great-grandson of Takamochi, moved to Ise Province (currently part of Mie Prefecture) and established an important Daimyo dynasty.[3]\n\nLater, the Kanmu Heishi lineage had many branches, including Hōjō, Chiba, Miura and Hatakeyama clans.[4][5]\n",
