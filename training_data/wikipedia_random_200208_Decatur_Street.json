  "content": "200, 202, 204, 206 and 208 Decatur Street are adjoining rowhouses in Cumberland, Allegany County, Maryland. The houses were built in the 1840s or early 1850s. The houses are of a type that, while common elsewhere in Maryland, were not extensively built in Cumberland, in which individual and semi-detached houses were more common. The houses exhibit plain but consistent detailing of a neoclassical nature.[2]\n\nThis article about a Registered Historic Place in Allegany County, Maryland is a stub.
