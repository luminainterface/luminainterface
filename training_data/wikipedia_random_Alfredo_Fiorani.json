Il solipsismo di genere femminile\" has returned to the attention of critics and readers otherwise impenetrable aspects of the writer, recreating the human and cultural climate in which the character moved, focusing on the role she attributed to women over the years. close to the Second World War.[30][31][32]\n\nIn the story-diary \"La crudeltà dell'onda\" he reported the experience he lived in first person, together with his partner Fausta, during the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake in which he suffered serious injuries to the head due to the collapses in his home in Via Santa Maria a Forfona, in the historic center, a stone's throw from the Basilica of San Bernardino, deciding to reach the hospital of Sulmona for the necessary treatments.[33]\n\nHaving recovered, a few months later, in November 2009, he published the book \"L'Aquila 2009: La mia verità sul terremoto\", written jointly with Giampaolo Giuliani, the former technician of the Institute of Interplanetary Space Physics seconded to the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, which became known for having allegedly predicted the occurrence of the seismic event.[34]\n\nIn fact, Giampaolo Giuliani would seem to have foreseen an earthquake of significant magnitude, but in Sulmona, not in L'Aquila, and at the end of May, not on April 6:[35] this had cost the technician a report for alarm – whose procedure is it was then archived in December 2009 by the Judge for preliminary investigations of Sulmona, Massimo Di Cesare, who accepted the request of the Public Prosecutor, Aura Scarsella – in addition to fierce criticism from the scientific community and the mass media.[36][37]\n\nThe book \"La forza della memoria\" published in 2010, also written with Giampaolo Giuliani, is therefore a reprimand addressed to the official scientific community, guilty – in the opinion of the two authors – of having committed many errors of evaluation in the last three centuries as well as (would) have happened for the earthquake of L'Aquila.[38][39]\n\nBoth books have had a wide echo in Italy, both for the well-known events that have determined and accompanied their publication, and for being serious and documented technical works.[40]\n\nOn the occasion of the administrative elections of May 6 and 7, 2012 it joined the Sinistra Ecologia Libertà list in support of the candidate for mayor of the Municipality of L'Aquila, Massimo Cialente, for his second term.[41]\n\nAlthough unable to access the benches of the City Council, he continued his ecological commitment by dealing with climate issues with the aim of bringing the general public closer to ecological and environmental issues, coming to publish in June 2014 the essay \"Contronatura. Il caos climatico\" in which he conducted a journalistic and popular analysis of the events that in recent history have changed the approach to climate phenomena.[42][43]\n\nIn 2015 he published the book \"L'immortalità delle vittime. Gli abruzzesi alla grande guerra\", in which he collected memories and testimonies, trying to trace the impact that World War I had on Abruzzo and on the young people who sacrificed their existence for it.[44][45]\n\nIn 2017 the essay \"I prigionieri di guerra austro-ungarici nei campi di concentramento italiani\" was published, written by him together with Edoardo Puglielli, in which the authors trace the story – little known to the general public – of the birth of the Romanian Legion of Italy and internment camps scattered in Abruzzo as in all of Italy, where men belonging to the most disparate linguistic-cultural groups were locked up to be used as agricultural, industrial and public utility workers, underpaid compared to local labor, or to be left to die of hardship and disease.[46][47][48]\n\nThis latest historical essay will however be published after the author's death, which occurred following a long illness on February 29, 2016, in Lanciano.[49][50]\n",
