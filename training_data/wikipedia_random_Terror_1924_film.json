They fall in love. Professor Aldrich (Lorfeuil), her father, is the inventor of a death ray which is expected to accomplish great things in war. The secret is stolen and Helen's lover is suspected of the theft, so Helen sets out to prove his innocence. She does, after meeting with a variety of adventures, clearing the man she loves, and effecting the arrest of the gang leader.\n\nThis article related to a French film of the 1920s is a stub.
