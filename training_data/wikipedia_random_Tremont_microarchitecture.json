  "content": "Tremont is a microarchitecture for low-power Atom, Celeron and Pentium Silver branded processors used in systems on a chip (SoCs) made by Intel. It is the successor to Goldmont Plus.[2] Intel officially launched Elkhart Lake platform with 10 nm Tremont core on September 23, 2020.[3] Intel officially launched Jasper Lake platform with 10 nm Tremont core on January 11, 2021.[4]\n\nTremont is the third generation out-of-order low-power Atom microarchitecture designed for entry-level desktop and notebook computers. Tremont is built on the 10 nm manufacturing process and supports up to 24 cores.[5] It includes the Intel Gen11 graphics architecture from Ice Lake.\n\nTremont microarchitecture provides the following enhancements over Goldmont Plus:\n\nList of mobile processors as follows:[8]\n\n[MB]\n\n[MB]\n\nPentacore Lakefield CPU consists of 1 \"big\" Sunny Cove core and 4 \"little\" Tremont cores. AVX support on Sunny Cove (still physically present) is disabled to match Tremont core.\n\n[MB]\n\nThese processors are exclusively produced for cell phone radio manufacturers.[9]\n\n[MB]\n\nList of embedded processors as follows:[10]\n\nmodel\n\n[MB]\n\n2 × DDR4-3200\n\n2 × DDR4-3200\n\n2 × DDR4-3200\n",
