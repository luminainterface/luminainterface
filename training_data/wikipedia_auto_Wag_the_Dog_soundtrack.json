  "content": "Wag the Dog is the sixth soundtrack album by British singer-songwriter and guitarist Mark Knopfler, released on 13 January 1998 by Vertigo Records internationally, and by Mercury Records in the United States. The album contains music composed for the 1997 film Wag the Dog, directed by Barry Levinson. The film featured songs created for the fictitious campaign waged by the protagonists, including \"Good Old Shoe\", \"The American Dream\", and \"The Men of the 303\". These songs appear on the soundtrack album as instrumental tracks. Only the title track contains vocals.[1]\n\nIn his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars, calling it one of Knopfler's \"best scores, alternately graceful and rootsy.\"[1]\n\nAll music was written by Mark Knopfler.[1][2]\n",
