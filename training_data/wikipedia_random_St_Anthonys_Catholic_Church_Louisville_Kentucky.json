  "content": "The former St. Anthony's Catholic Church is a redbrick historic Roman Catholic steepled church  complex located at 2222-2238 West Market Street in Louisville, Kentucky. Designed by noted local architect William H. Redin in the Gothic Revival style of architecture, it was built in 1887. After a disastrous fire on January 26, 1939, which caused extensive damage to all buildings in the complex except the rectory to the left of the church, architect Walter C. Wagner Sr. designed the reconstruction of the complex which was done by Skilton and Sullivan Construction Company.\n\nIn 1978, the parish school was merged with St. Cecilia School and Our Lady of the Port Academy to form Community Catholic School on the St. Cecilia campus. On March 1, 1982, the complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places.[1][2] In 2011, the Archdiocese of Louisville closed the church, merging its boundaries into those of the nearby Good Shepherd Parish. The centennial was celebrated on June 17, 1984.[3]\n\nThis article about a property in Jefferson County, Kentucky on the National Register of Historic Places is a stub.
